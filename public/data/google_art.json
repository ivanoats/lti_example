His thoughts about Japanese painting and his passion for landscape gardening produced 165,000 square meters Japanese garden: The Dry Landscape Garden, The White Gravel and Pine Garden, he Moss Garden, and The Pond Garden. With every step you take, the graceful view before you makes you calm and in accordance with the Japanese paintings. The changing seasons, with azaleas in the spring time, the soft verdant green in summer, the glowing red of maples in autumn, and the snowscape of winter, all add to tour enjoyment of the museum. The museum collection of artwork includes the work of such great artists of modern Japanese painting as Yokoyama Taikan, Takeuchi Seiho, Kawai Gyokudo, Tomioka Tessai, Sakakibara Shiho and Uemura Shoen, among others. The paintings, close to 1,500 in number , are shown at four special exhibitions each year. Moreover, now is the time to see the elegant gardens and the great paintings together, Our museum is noted for having the largest collection of Taikan's work and twenty of his works are regularly on exhibit. The museum's main building also houses various works by two master ceramic artists, Kawai Kanjiro and Kitaoji Rosanjin, paintings for children by artists such works. In addition, the annex offers the opportunity to enjoy the originality of contemporary Japanese paintings.",

    "description": "<b>58 Artists, 95 Artworks</b><br/>Stüler's overall proposal of a \"sanctuary for art and science\" (1841) centres on a temple-like building based on the sketches made by Friedrich Wilhelm IV in his own hand. From 1862 to 1865 Friedrich August Stüler developed these into the plans for the Nationalgalerie, which in turn were realized by Johann Heinrich Strack after Stüler's death.\n\nThe high base and nominating steps in front of its façade and in its interior, as well as its pediment's programmatic inscription \"Der Deutschen Kunst\" (\"To German Art\"), made the Nationalgalerie, which was opened in 1876, a monument to a new, patriotic consciousness. Later, around 1900, the subject matter of 19th century art opened up to French painting. This new, internationally focused concept brought with it incisive changes to the construction in the interior.\n\nAfter much destruction wrought by World War II in 1944, it was already possible to reopen part of the Nationalgalerie in 1949, and visits to both levels became possible in 1950. When the Neue Nationalgalerie by Mies van der Rohe opened at Potsdamer Platz in 1968, the Nationalgalerie on the Museumsinsel became known as the \"Alte\" (Old) Nationalgalerie.",

    "description": "<b>4 Artists, 76 Artworks</b><br/>In 1810, Wilhelm von Humboldt was commissioned by King Friedrich Wilhelm III \"to build up a public, well selected collection of art in Berlin.\" The year 1830 saw the opening of the Königliches Museum am Lustgarten (Royal Museum at the Pleasure Garden), which had been built in accordance with plans by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. This building added the field of art as a fourth element to the open parallelogram of politics (Schloss, i.e. palace), the military (Zeughaus, i.e. arsenal) and the church (Dom, i.e. cathedral).\n\nThe central rotunda harks back to the Pantheon in ancient Rome and, together with the façade of columns, forms one of the most mature works of the classical period, influencing style well into the 20th century. This first museum building in Berlin initially brought together a collection of classical antiquities, a picture gallery and a numismatic collection; in future, this building will be devoted exclusively to classical antiquity.\n\nNear the end of World War II the Altes Museum caught fire and almost burned to the ground. After restoration, from 1966 onward it served as a museum of contemporary art of the DDR (East Germany) and was used for special exhibitions.\n\nThe Altes Museum was heavily damaged in the Second World War and rebuilt up to 1966 to house East German art. After the fall of the Berlin wall and reunification, special exhibitions helped it achieve widespread popularity in Berlin's new city centre.\n\nIn 1998 the \"Antiquarium\" - consisting of small artifacts from the Collection of Classical Antiquities - moved from its split locations of Charlottenburg and the upper level of the Pergamonmuseum and was restored to its historical location. Since then, the Greek art has been presented on the main floor of the Altes Museum. As of July 2010 a new permanent exhibition on the upper floor will present an exquisite selection of the rich holdings of Etruscan and Roman art. Subsequently, the Greek art will be combined with the sculptures from the Pergamonmuseum and be presented in a new integrated exhibition from February 2011. For the first time since 1939, the entire building will then be dedicated to the Collection of Classical Antiquities.\n\nThe future overall refurbishment based on the plans of Hilmer & Sattler and Albrecht (Munich/Berlin) will connect the Altes Museum spatially and thematically to the other buildings on the Museumsinsel via the Archaeological Promenade. Other key elements of the draft are to gain the elevated ground floor for exhibition purposes and service facilities, and to make the building accessible to the handicapped. The two courtyards are to be made available for use with the addition of a glass roof.",

    "description": "<b>79 Artists, 85 Artworks</b><br/><p>Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki opened its doors on 17 February 1888 and is the oldest purpose-built art gallery in New Zealand. The founding gifts of Sir George Grey and James Tannock Mackelvie were instrumental in the Gallery’s establishment and these public-spirited gestures heralded a culture of patronage by generous individuals.</p>\n\n<p>Several major gifts were received from the early 1900s onward. Chief among these were 72 paintings by Gottfried Lindauer which depict Māori. Henry Partridge commissioned Lindauer to produce a pictorial account of the Māori people. The Partridge Collection is the most significant collection of indigenous portraiture in Australasia. Rarely has a gift been so finely calculated in its wider cultural and philanthropic effect.</p>\n\n<p>The Gallery effectively entered the modern era in 1953 with the arrival of its first professional director, Eric Westbrook, a specialist art historian. Beginning at this time, a plethora of social and educational events in support of the Gallery were organised by the Art Gallery Associates. Now the Friends of the Gallery, this group gives invaluable support, particularly for acquisitions. Westbrook persuaded the Auckland City Council to provide annual funds for acquisitions, which they have continued to do ever since.  Led by Westbrook the institution became increasingly confident and adopted an ordered approach to the development of its collections and their exhibition and interpretation.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Tomory, Assistant Regional Director for the Arts Council of Great Britain, was appointed to the Gallery in 1956. Tomory’s task was one of consolidation, his aim to ‘establish a high professional status not only for the Gallery but also for its staff’. He built up a collection of modern French sculpture, increased the purchase and exhibition of New Zealand art, both historical and contemporary, expanded the Gallery’s Research Library and initiated the publication of the Art Gallery Quarterly, a review of acquisitions which was published until 1978.</p> \n\n<p>Tomory achieved local notoriety – and huge audiences for the Gallery – by bringing an exhibition of Henry Moore sculpture to Auckland in 1956; and international acclaim for his discovery in Dunedin of an outstanding group of 37 drawings by Henry Fuseli. Purchased for the Gallery, the collection includes drawings from most decades of the artist’s œuvre and from almost all his subjects – the Bible, ancient history, classical mythology, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton and Dante.</p>\n\n<p>Westbrook and Tomory established a focus on the New Zealand collection which all subsequent directors have emulated. The Gallery is now home to an extensive collection of international and New Zealand artworks numbering close to 15,000.</p>\n\n<p>With the rapid growth of the Gallery’s collection, the historic building has undergone a succession of extensions and alterations. The most recent redevelopment opened to the public in September 2011. This ambitious building project restored and preserved the building’s iconic heritage fabric while adding large contemporary exhibition spaces, extensive glazing and new outdoor sculpture terraces. The redeveloped Gallery is at the centre of a city whose energy and enthusiasm for the arts continues to grow.</p> ",

(then known as the Filipinas Foundation, Inc.). The museum's first home was in the Insular Life Building on Ayala Avenue in Makati. In 1974, the first Ayala Museum building on Makati Avenue, designed by the late National Artist for Architecture, Leandro V. Locsin, was inaugurated. The museum's current building on the corner of De La Rosa Street was formally dedicated on September 28, 2004. It was Ayala's gift to the Filipino people in celebration of the Ayala Corporation's 170th anniversary. Led by Leandro Y. Locsin, Jr, the museum was designed by the architectural firm Leandro V. Locsin and Partners.</p>\n\n<p>Forming the core of the museum's historical collections are sixty handcrafted dioramas that chronicle the rich tapestry of Philippine history. Ayala Museum also features a one-of-a-kind boat gallery showcasing miniatures of some of the watercrafts that contributed to the development of Philippine maritime trade and colonial economy. Archaeological and ethnographic objects from the country's northern and southern cultural communities complement the historical collection. The fine arts collection features important works by three painters considered pioneers in Philippine art--Juan Luna (1857-1899), Fernando Amorsolo (1882-1972), and Fernando Zobel (1924-1984). Genre paintings from the 19th century Philippines are represented. This period reflect some of Europe's liberal ideas that gave rise to secular themes in Philippine art and popularized new modes of expressions.</p>",

    "description": "<b>95 Artists, 510 Artworks</b><br/>The Benaki Museum of Greek Civilization, founded by Anthony Benakis and donated to the Greek state in 1931, is the oldest of the five functioning museums of the Benaki Museum organisation. Its mission is to present, through its collections, Greek art and material culture in a geographical and evolutionary context, from prehistory to the present. Unique examples of ceramics, sculpture and jewellery are included in its Geometric, Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine collections. The transition from the ancient periods to the Byzantine world is illustrated in the collection of textiles, oil-lamps, clay figurines and bone carvings from Alexandria  and in a rare group of Coptic works of art. Byzantine and post-Byzantine icons, ecclesiastical embroidery and metalwork reveal the impact of Christianity on the art of the times. Costumes, jewellery, embroidery, ceramics, wood-carvings, paintings and metalwork complete the presentation of Greek art in the four post-Byzantine centuries. By virtue of its collections, the Benaki Museum cannot be classified only as a museum of decorative arts, an art museum or a historical museum; it is rather, the museum of Greek civilization, in all its pertinent manifestations. \nThe new millenium marked the expansion of the Benaki Museum and its development into a complex museum organisation: In 2000, the Benaki Museum of Greek Civilization re-opened after 10 years of renovation works, featuring the Greek collections. Four years later, in 2004, the Benaki Museum of Islamic Art was inaugurated, a unique collection of world-renowned artefacts exhibited in the only  such museum in Greece. During the same year, the Pireos street Annex opened officially, a multidynamic cultural centre able to host all types of events and exhibitions. Two more museums —the Studio of Yannis Pappas and the Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghika Gallery—, three active Archival Departments (Photographic, Architectural, Historical) and a rich Library come together to establish the Benaki Museum as the most active and dynamic museum organisations in Greece, a space which promotes knowledge, research, contemplation, exchange of ideas and freedom of expression.\nThe Benaki Museum is committed in presenting emerging knowledge about its collections through educational activities for children and adults, publications, exhibitions and events, nationally and internationally. \n",

Several generations of princes made the Domain a bastion of aristocracy that was relatively independent of the monarchy, and therefore somewhat protected. Using the former medieval castle as a foundation, these occupants gradually built a structure to house sumptuous living quarters, with each generation saving the building from deterioration. Today, it stands as an exceptional example of 19th century architecture (the period during which it underwent its most recent modifications), a movement inspired by various trends, including the Renaissance, as beautifully illustrated by the châteaus at Fontainebleau and Ecouen.\n\nThe various rooms in the Château de Chantilly house one of France’s largest collections of French and Italian paintings as well as rare books and manuscripts : works by Raphael, Clouet, Poussin, Watteau, Ingres, Géricault, Delacroix, Corot and the famous illuminated manuscript of the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry. A tour of the museum’s collections is also an opportunity to visit the private living quarters of princes, with their galleries, rooms and masterpieces of decorative art.\n\nSome figures\n\nThe Condé Museum’s collection consists of 15,000 pieces, including the following:\n\n- 830 paintings\n\n- 5,000 drawings and engravings\n\n- 1,700 old photographs\n\n- 250 sculptures\n\nThe library and archives contain 158,000 documents, including the following:\n\n- 2,000 manuscripts\n\n- 10,500 rare and precious printed books\n\n- 3,000 portfolios or registers of old archives\n\n- historical correspondence (80,000 letters)\n\n- old charts and maps (10,000 documents)\n\n",

    "description": "<b>158 Artists, 207 Artworks</b><br/><p>As part of his gift to the nation, Charles Lang Freer provided one million dollars for the construction of a museum to house his collections of Asian and American art. He selected Charles Adams Platt, an architect and landscape designer who was trained as a painter, to design the museum in 1913. Together they devised a two-story plan for the building, settling on the style of an Italian Renaissance palazzo with a central court open to the sky. The museum's design reflected Freer's belief that the appreciation of art could be enhanced by \"lack of confusion, sympathetic surroundings, and perfect opportunity to observe or study the exhibits in a proper way.\" On the main floor, eighteen galleries and Whistler's Peacock Room were linked to each other by four connecting corridors. Planned in every respect for the comfort and convenience of visitors, the museum was said to be one of the healthiest spots in the District of Columbia. The cornerstone was laid in 1916. Freer was unwell and could not attend the ceremony, but he kept an eye on the work in progress. Although construction was interrupted by the First World War, the museum was virtually complete by the autumn of 1919. Charles Freer died that September, never having seen the building that would, at his request, bear his name in a \"modest and appropriate form.\" In May 1923, the Freer Gallery of Art opened to the public as the first art museum in the Smithsonian Institution. The Freer Gallery of Art and the neighboring Arthur M. Sackler Gallery together form the Smithsonian's national museums of Asian art. Facts about the building: 1) The Freer Gallery of Art was the first museum in the Smithsonian Institution devoted exclusively to the fine arts. It so embodies the spirit of its founder that an acquaintance of Charles Lang Freer once called it \"Mr. Freer's autobiography.\" 2) During a major renovation in the early 1990s, the Freer courtyard was entirely removed, leaving a gaping hole at the center of the building. Some 27,000 works of art were kept in temporary quarters while expanded space for collections storage was created below the courtyard. 3) When the museum opened in 1923, live peacocks roamed the Freer courtyard as living tributes to the golden birds that adorn the walls of Whistler's Peacock Room. One of the Freer Gallery's most widely known works, it was named an \"icon of American Art\" by the National Endowment for the Humanities. The Freer Gallery of Art, located on Jefferson Drive at 12th Street SW, on the National Mall in Washington, is open every day except December 25. Hours are from 10 am until 5:30 pm, and admission is free.</p>\n\nFor more information about the gallery watch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDG8XDt2mc",

    "description": "<b>19 Artists, 33 Artworks</b><br/>From Caspar David Friedrich to Gerhard Richter. The broad spectrum of works extending from the Romantic period to the present day and the exceptional quality of the paintings in the collection are the defining features of the Galerie Neue Meister (New Masters Gallery) and makes it one of the most important museums of its kind in Germany. The exhibition in the Albertinum contains masterpieces by the Romantic painters as well as 20th-century art and contemporary works. Contemporary art enters into an exciting dialogue with the older holdings of the collection. The 21st-century visitor encounters a broad intellectual universe in which the various stylistic periods are presented in unusual proximity, so that they are experienced in a new and different way.\n\nThe tour through the exhibition begins with several masterpieces by Caspar David Friedrich, the most important German Romantic artist. It then proceeds in chronological order, featuring further representatives of the Romantic movement (Carl Gustav Carus, Johan Christian Dahl, Ludwig Richter), French and German Impressionists (Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Max Liebermann, Max Slevogt), Expressionists such as Otto Dix and the Brücke artists (Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff) as well as representatives of the Dresden Secession (Bernhard Kretzschmar, Carl Lohse). For the first time a full room are dedicated to each of the artists Sigmar Polke and Georg Baselitz. The tour ends with two halls containing works by Gerhard Richter, which the artist himself designed and for which he has created new works. New media are represented in the form of (sound and video) installations and video films. Occasionally there are surprising encounters with works from the Skulpturensammlung (Sculpture Collection), which is also housed in the Albertinum. \n\nThe Galerie Neue Meister (New Masters Gallery) is part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) that are among the most prominent museums in the world. The combined holdings of the twelve museums offer the visitor a remarkable thematic diversity. These museums originated from the collections of the Saxon electors and Polish kings. They systematically developed cabinets of curiosities, which were accessible to select circles in their day and still form the core of the wonderful art treasures of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden today. The collections are situated in world famous buildings such as the Residenzschloss (Royal Palace), the Zwinger, and the Semperbau (Semper Building), which are among the most important sights in Dresden.",

The competition for the Gemäldegalerie new building, held in 1986, went to architects Hilmer and Sattler. With Prussian exactness, the building's minimal design rises above the tapering piazetta below, while inside its various rooms are grouped around a bright, well-lit lobby. A study gallery was added to the  after the sweeping events of 1989 and 1990 that also led to the reunification of the various collections belonging to the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin a year later in 1991. In its architectural reserve, the building's minimal outer design is reminiscent of Schinkel's Altes Museum, while inside, the collection rooms bear similar classical proportions. From the large central lobby, itself a place of peace and contemplation with the water fountain and sculpture by Walter de Maria, visitors can delve back into the individual exhibition rooms and recontinue their tour through the collection. The consequential use of daylight illumination throughout sets a benchmark for other major art galleries.

    "description": "<b>27 Artists, 49 Artworks</b><br/>The young Johann Wolfgang Goethe was enraptured by his visit to the Dresden Gemäldegalerie (Picture Gallery): “My amazement was beyond words!” He saw the masterpieces when they were still exhibited in the Johanneum, densely packed with three rows of paintings hanging one above the other. Nevertheless, the collection that he admired consisted of more or less the same selection of works that are presented in the Semperbau (Semper Building) today. The amazement and astonishment of the visitors has not changed since Goethe’s time: year after year the Gallery attracts more than 500,000 art lovers from all over the world.\n\nThe great renown of Dresden’s Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (Old Masters Picture Gallery) is due to the outstanding selection of top-quality masterpieces contained within it. One of the main collecting focal points of the museum is Italian Renaissance art, with major works by Raphael e.g. the “Sistine Madonna” (1512/13), Giorgione, Titian, Correggio, Mantegna, Botticelli, Parmigianino, Veronese and Tintoretto. Another important group consists of paintings by 17th-century Dutch and Flemish masters. The large number of high-quality works includes paintings by Rembrandt and his school, as well as Ruysdael and the great Flemish artists Rubens, Jordaens and Van Dyck. There are hardly more than 30 paintings in the world known to be by Johannes Vermeer of Delft. The Dresden gallery’s two works by this inimitable Dutch master constitute a special attraction.\nOther works on display include exceptional Old German and Old Dutch paintings, including works by Jan van Eyck, Dürer, Cranach and Holbein, as well as outstanding works by Spanish and French artists of the 17th century. Among the most famous are Ribera and Murillo, Poussin and Lorrain. The quality of the gallery’s holdings, as well as Semper’s splendid building with its magnificent architectural features continue to set standards even today – and the astonishment is certain to endure.\n\nThe Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (Old Masters Picture Gallery) is part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) that are among the most prominent museums in the world.

Together with the Royal Armoury and Skokloster Castle the  Museum constitutes a national authority, headed by a Director General, and accountable to the Ministry of Culture. The three museums base their work on a national cultural policy resolution enacted by Swedish Parliament. The palatial looking town-house was designed by the architect Isak Gustaf Clason and built between 1893-1898 for Walther and Wilhelmina von Hallwyl. It is considered one of the most lavish private residences in Sweden from that time. In contrast to the architecture with its references to past styles, all manner of modern technology were introduced at the outset, such as central heating, electric lighting and elevators. In 1920 Walther and Wilhelmina von Hallwyl donated their home with its contents to the Swedish State. The terms of the bequest stipulated that the house must remain essentially unchanged and in 1938 it opened as a museum. Apart from Wilhelmina von Hallwyl's art collections the museum also houses the family's personal belongings and household objects and therefore also offer insight into life of an upper-class family at the end of the 19th century.\n\nBACKGROUND\nWilhelmina von Hallwyl (1844-1930) was the heiress to a vast fortune amassed by her industrialist father Wilhelm Kempe. In 1865 she was married to the Swiss citizen Walther von Hallwyl (1839-1921). The couple settled in a country house south of Stockholm where they raised their family of four daughters. After the death of Wilhelm Kempe in 1883 they moved into the city of Stockholm since it was decided that Walther should take succeed his father-in-law as managing director for the family business. Meanwhile  Wilhelmina von Hallwyl devoted much time and money to enlarge her art-collections and alongside little by little she also came to the conclusion that she wanted to have her home preserved as a museum. Her collections also became exceptionally well documented since she had every item in the house, including mundane household objects, meticulously catalogued. The catalogue, finished onl=\ny in 1955, comprises 78 volumes and was printed in a limited edition of 110 copies. In 1920 the house with all its contents was bequeathed to the nation and in 1938 Hallwyl Museum opened to the public.\n",

    "description": "<b>40 Artists, 52 Artworks</b><br/>The Hungarian National Gallery is the largest public collection for documenting and presenting the emergence and evolution of fine arts in Hungary. Its permanent exhibitions provide a comprehensive survey of the history of Hungarian art, beginning with the foundation of the Kingdom of Hungary, and ranging from the earliest monuments to contemporary works.\n\nHISTORY OF THE ROYAL PALACE IN BUDA CASTLE\nThe Royal Palace in Buda Castle, which hosts the Hungarian National Gallery, underwent ongoing construction during the reign of kings Louis the Great, Sigismund, and Matthias, developing into a magnificent royal residence. Its state of repair, however, steadily deteriorated during the Turkish occupation beginning in 1541. Once the Turks had been driven out of the country, work began on restoring the remaining Gothic and Renaissance buildings in the then fashionable Baroque style. The history of the existing buildings of the Hungarian National Gallery dates back to the reign of Maria Theresa. Erection of a castle much smaller than the original commenced in 1750 under the leadership of Ignác Oracsek, according to plans by imperial chief architect Jean Nicolas Jadot. The late Baroque edifice was completed by Franz Anton Hillebrandt. At the end of the 19th century, another wing was added to the palace. Architects Miklós Ybl and Alajos Hauszmann employed neo-Baroque ornamentation to decorate the building. In the Second World War the palace was severely damaged; reconstruction started in the 1950s. Established in 1957 and first housed in the former Palace of Justice in Kossuth Square, the Hungarian National Gallery occupied its current premises in 1975, moving into Buildings B, C and D of Buda Palace, refurbished for the purpose of housing an art museum. The premises were extended in 2005 with the addition of Building A.\n\nMEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STONE CARVINGS\nThis collection contains fragments of sculptures, carved architectural elements of artistic value, and fragments of tombstones from the period stretching from the 11th to the 16th centuries. Besides major assemblages from the abbey church at Ják, the medieval cathedral at Kalocsa, and the Cistercian abbey at Pilisszentkereszt, it features emblematic pieces of medieval art in Hungary such as the Fragment of the lid of a tomb from Aracs, a King’s Head from Kalocsa, a Stone slab with the figure of Jacob carved in relief from Pécs, and fragments of Queen Gertrude’s tomb from Pilisszentkereszt. The collection also includes valuable Renaissance fragments such as that of a Madonna-altarpiece from Diósgyôr attributed to Giovanni Dalmata, and a relief from Nyitra (presently Nitra, Slovakia) with a carved figure of Christ Taking Leave of His Mother.\n\nPANEL PAINTINGS AND WOOD CARVINGS FROM THE GOTHIC PERIOD\nMedieval winged altarpieces and fragments are displayed on the ground floor and on the first floor. On the ground floor can be seen the earliest pieces in the collection, works dating from the 14th century. Of these works, two sculptures of the Virgin and the Child, from Toporc (presently Toporec, Slovakia) and Szlatvin (presently Slatvina, Slovakia) respectively, deserve special attention. \n\nLATE GOTHIC WINGED ALTARPIECES\nThe ground floor exhibition of wood carvings and panel paintings from the Late Middle Ages continues on the first floor, in the former throne room of the palace, and in two rooms connecting to it. Amongst the exhibits are the most splendid works of late medieval altarpiece painting, including The Visitation by Master MS, from the high altar at Selmecbánya (presently Banská Štiavnica, Slovakia; see on the cover). Here a total of fifteen largely intact winged altarpieces and a number of additional fragments are on display. Most of the works exhibited here date from the early 16th century.\n\nLATE RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE ART\nThe permanent exhibition of Late Renaissance and Baroque art (1550–1800) starts with Mannerist works made in Vienna and Prague in the years around 1600. Contained in the exhibition space are 17th-century Hungarian ecclesiastical treasures, wooden epitaphs, tomb sculptures, depictions of saints of the Árpád dynasty dressed in Hungarian attire. Next, an assortment consisting mainly of portraits and still lifes evokes the culture of aristocratic residences in the Age of the Baroque. Besides monumental works, altarpieces and fresco sketches help recall the richness of Baroque ecclesiastical art. Outstanding among them are works representing scenes from the legends of Hungarian royal saints. Besides portraits and landscapes, late 18th-century art from the Age of Enlightenment is represented by early rural genre pictures and historical genre paintings.\n\nART IN THE 19TH CENTURY\nOur permanent exhibitions of 19th-century art present a survey of the output of about 100 years beginning in the late 18th century. On show here are almost all of the most significant works of National Romanticism. The surrounding suite of rooms hosts landscapes by Károly Markó; Biedermeier genre pictures, sometimes wistful, sometimes delicately erotic; works attesting to painters’ discovery of the Hungarian landscape; and the best-known works of Hungarian portrait painting. Masterpieces by József Borsos, Miklós Barabás, Mihály Zichy, Gyula Benczúr and Bertalan Székely are especially exciting items in the exhibition. A separate room contains the works of Mihály Munkácsy and the greatest innovators in 19th-century Hungarian art.\n\nTWENTIETH-CENTURY ART BEFORE 1945\nOpened in 2002, this exhibition surveys the most important trends in the fine arts in Hungary from the generation that founded the Nagybánya artists’ colony in the 1890s (Simon Hollósy, Károly Ferenczy) to the mid-1940s. In line with a fresh approach to exhibition design, works are not arranged in strict chronological order; rather, each room is an independent unit in its own right. On show here is the work of the most important artists (József Rippl-Rónai, Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka, Ferenc Medgyessy, Róbert Berény, Gyula Derkovits) and groups of artists (the Eight, the Activists, the Rome School, the Gresham Circle). The work of the most significant Hungarian graphic artists is presented in a continually refreshed exhibition.\n\n TWENTIETH-CENTURY ART AFTER 1945\nThe exhibition features works of art from the postwar period, showing a complexity of styles existing side by side and mutually influencing one another (Expressionism, Constructivism, Surrealism etc.). The new art scene, reinvigorated beginning about 1960, is represented by works of prominent masters of both the older and younger generations (Endre Bálint, Ignác Kokas, Menyhért Tóth, Béla Kondor). In subsequent rooms are works representing nonfigurative tendencies coexisting with Geometrical, Structuralist and Organic endeavours that span generations. Next to ever renewing figurative tendencies—individual variants of Pop Art and Hyperrealism—the corridor opening from the suite of rooms contains works of an Avant-Garde becoming more radical around 1980, including works based primarily on the use of photographs, and objects.\n",

Today the museum has consolidated its prestige and has become a referent not only for the city, but for the contemporary art.\n\nBordering the historic city centre, the IVAM emerges as a cry of modernity. In just two decades has achieved the privilege of being part of the international circuit of modern and contemporary art and, at the same time, has become a major attraction for researchers, artists and tourists.\n\nJulio González’s work, which combines the main artistic movements of the beginning of the twentieth century, sets one of its main purposes: the continual updating of modern art production. But there is also space for precursors in the museum. Some of them, such as Ignacio Picazo, are of major importance in the IVAM collection. They were later joined by new names, works of art and, overall, artistic movements that have went through the twentieth century. Some of them emerged in Europe, but others were born in the United States or in South America.\n\nPhotography and photo-collage, Pop Art, abstraction, sculpture, installations and new media art and drawing on paper are part of what is currently considered as one of the most comprehensive art collections of contemporary art, with more than ten thousand five hundred pieces from distinct artists that represent the modernity and contemporaneity of the twentieth century at the beginning of the twenty first century.\n\nThe IVAM has recently become a meeting point for Valencian visitors, for tourists, researchers or anyone who wants to dive into the world of contemporary art have within reach the work of some of the artists that have drawn contemporary art history.\n\nOn behalf of the IVAM I would like to welcome everybody that approaches the museum through this website. I welcome the sporadic visitors and those devoted to contemporaneity. I welcome the artists, the friends of the IVAM, the Members of Honour, the museum’s sponsors and everyone who visits this site, because the IVAM will continue adapting to modernity to keep alive the interest for modern art among Valencian citizens.

    "description": "<b>11 Artists, 11 Artworks</b><br/>From May to October each year, the Kunstgewerbemuseum (Museum of Decorative Arts) provides extraordinary insights into the life of the electors of Saxony in a spectacular architectural setting. Schloss Pillnitz (Pillnitz Palace), a pleasure palace and the summer residence of the Saxon court, is only a few kilometers from the centre of Dresden, idyllically located between the River Elbe and hillside vineyards. Many sumptuous objects and rooms that are associated with the electors and kings of Saxony have been preserved here. There are, for example, gilt thrones, unique silver furniture, colorful lacquered furniture and other lavish furnishings commissioned by the rulers, as well as numerous outstanding items created in the court workshops, all of which testify to the sovereigns’ desire for luxury and elegance. Among the objects on display are beautifully painted and cut glasses from the court wine cellars, exclusive textiles such as damask fabric, embroidery and lace, as well as selected items from the royal collection of Italian majolica, Delftware and German stoneware.\n\nOther highlights – ranging from a medieval antependium to 20th-century furniture – demonstrate the history of regional and international arts and crafts over a period of five centuries. In this journey through time showing the history of arts and crafts up to modern industrial design, numerous examples of Dresden Jugendstil (Art Nouveau) and of the machine-made furniture produced by the “Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau” constitute particular highlights that point to Dresden’s role as a cradle of modern art and design. Examples of the work of contemporary designers include products by Piero Fornasetti, Shiro Kuramata, Ron Arad, Dale Chihuly and many others.\nIf you particularly wish to enjoy the atmosphere of the bygone age of Saxon electors and kings, you should visit the Gelbe Salon (Yellow Salon) with its magnificent chinoiserie-style decor, the dining-room in the style of Watteau or the series of cabinets in the Weinlig-Zimmer (Weinlig Room) – these were all used by the royal family during their summer sojourns at Schloss Pillnitz (Pillnitz Palace).\n\nThe Kunstgewerbemuseum (Museum of Decorative Arts) is part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) that are among the most prominent museums in the world. The combined holdings of the twelve museums offer the visitor a remarkable thematic diversity. These museums originated from the collections of the Saxon electors and Polish kings. They systematically developed cabinets of curiosities, which were accessible to select circles in their day and still form the core of the wonderful art treasures of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden today. The collections are situated in world famous buildings such as the Residenzschloss (Royal Palace), the Zwinger, and the Semperbau (Semper Building), which are among the most important sights in Dresden.",

    "description": "<b>21 Artists, 106 Artworks</b><br/>It took five decades to compile the collection. In 2001 it found its definite location. Together with the Republic of Austria and the Austrian National Bank, the collector Dr. Rudolf Leopold, who died in 2010 at the age of 85, consolidated his collection, which is now exhibited in a museum built by the Austrian state, into a private foundation. It is the largest and most visited museum in the newly created Museums Quartier.\n\nThe main focus of the collection lies on Austrian art of the first half of the 20th century, including major paintings and drawings by Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt. Here the transition from art nouveau to expressionism gets comprehensible step by step. The art historic context is imparted by Austrian 19th and 20th century masterpieces.\n\nIn the spacious rooms awash with light one does not only encounter paintings and drawings but also precious art handicraft and furniture of the era of the Wiener Werkst=E4tte and original artworks by Adolf Loos, Otto Wagner and Josef Hoffmann. A further focus of the collection lies on African and Oceanic sculptures. Such objects served as inspirational source for many artists of Classic Modernist movements.\n\nUntil the occupation of the museum, the Leopold family lived amid the paintings and used the furniture and everyday objects. What began with the first painting purchased by the young medical student Leopold, later truly got an obsession with art. In 1994 Rudolf Leopold consolidated more than 5,000 art objects into the private foundation valued at 575 million Euros.\n\nThe enormous increase in value stems mostly from the fact that the collector understood the value of art that was generally frowned upon long before others. Until the 1960s, Klimt and Schiele were not quite appreciated in Austria but even despised. Rudolf Leopold never listened to the verdicts of his contemporaries and at auctions sometimes even laid himself open to ridicule, like in 1954 when he purchased a nude study by Schiele, which was still regarded as degenerated and pornographic=93 back then, amidst laughter of the present audience.\n\nWhen buying or trading art, Leopold built on his esthetic judgment and\ntime proved him right. A subjective selection grew into a broadly recognized cultural institution, a collector=92s museum. Because of its content and substance, it is impossible to imagine the Viennese museum landscape without it by now. The huge cube made of bright stone coins the entire MuseumQuartier. Inside, one can gain insight into a pivotal part of Austrian history and cultural identity.\n\nTo discover overlooked art has always been and still is the principle of a collector, which also coins the program of special exhibitions. Besides academic accounting for Austrian art history, special exhibitions shine a light on confrontations of different artistic positions as well as new aspects of the collection.\n\nIn conversation with Professor Leopold, he liked to trace his success story back to his talent to comprehend the creation of an art work with his artistically seeing eye. His special skill resided in a more accurate perception, in an experienced comparison and inspired highlighting of what is essential. He always used his subjective feelings and moods to make a selection, a series or presentation. By doing so, he became the creator of an artistic synthesis born out of an unswervingly avant-garde attitude and quite in the sense of the Viennese secessionists. As a museum it now bears his name, as a whole it is metonymic with the Viennese Modern Age.",

It houses the only representative survey collection of Peruvian art, consisting of over twelve thousand works. This vast permanent collection, witness to several centuries of cultural transformations, includes pre-Columbian and colonial objects as well as republican and contemporary works. The development of the collections has gone hand in hand with a program of conservation and restoration which contributes to the preservation of the nation’s cultural patrimony. The museum has directed its efforts to opening up new perspectives in Peruvian art history, through academic research, and its dissemination through exhibitions, publications and public programs. Its education department contributes to the formation of thousands of pupils who seek to develop their artistic ability and broaden their knowledge. The museum’s library and archive constitutes one of the most important documentation centers for art history in the country. \n\nThe MALI’s activities are made possible through funds generated by the institution’s programs, generous contributions from the public and private sectors as well as donations by individuals committed to the development of art and culture in Peru. The museum is currently culminating the second stage of an ambitious renovation project, the first stage of which was concluded by April 2010. Thanks to the contribution of the Plan Copesco Nacional of the Ministry of Foreign Commerce and Tourism, the museum is now working on the renovation of its permanent exhibition galleries.

Take the world time clock constructed by Andreas Gärtner, for example: 365 supplementary dials are affixed to a large dial and show the time in 365 different locations on the earth. In about 1690 Andreas Gärtner found an amazing technical solution for the design of this clock – by utilizing the laws of gravity. Or take the spectacular astronomical clock. As early as the 1560s it was constructed in Marburg and Kassel on commission to Elector August of Saxony. It shows the position of the sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn in relation to the time of day – an astounding feat of technical expertise. \n\nThese two clocks are among the many masterpieces in the world-famous collection of historic clocks and scientific instruments held in the Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon (Royal Cabinet of Mathematical and Physical Instruments). Its holdings include terrestrial and celestial globes, fascinating optical, astronomical and geodetic devices dating back to the 16th century, as well as historic instruments for calculating, drawing and determining length, mass, temperature and air pressure. The objects provide an overview of the development of early precision mechanical devices, globes and clocks, and selected specimens demonstrate their application and their technical construction. In addition, they are works of art of the highest order, reflecting their princely origins.\nWhen the Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon (Royal Cabinet of Mathematical and Physical Instruments) reopens in April 2013 after the current period of refurbishment the museum will show how the world was surveyed in past centuries. \n\nThe Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon (Royal Cabinet of Mathematical and Physical Instruments) is part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) that are among the most prominent museums in the world. The combined holdings of the twelve museums offer the visitor a remarkable thematic diversity. These museums originated from the collections of the Saxon electors and Polish kings. They systematically developed cabinets of curiosities, which were accessible to select circles in their day and still form the core of the wonderful art treasures of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden today. The collections are situated in world famous buildings such as the Residenzschloss (Royal Palace), the Zwinger, and the Semperbau (Semper Building), which are among the most important sights in Dresden.",

    "description": "<b>45 Artists, 80 Artworks</b><br/>The Metropolitan Museum of Art's earliest roots date back to 1866 in Paris, France, when a group of Americans agreed to create a \"national institution and gallery of art\" to bring art and art education to the American people. On April 13, 1870, The Metropolitan Museum of Art was incorporated in New York City. On November 20 of that same year, the Museum acquired its first object, a Roman sarcophagus. On March 30, 1880, the Museum opened to the public at its current site in Central Park at Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street. \n\nThe Museum's collections continued to grow throughout the rest of the nineteenth century. The Museum's Beaux-Arts Fifth Avenue facade and Great Hall, designed by the architect and founding Museum Trustee Richard Morris Hunt, opened to the public in December 1902. The Evening Post reported that at last New York had a neoclassical palace of art, \"one of the finest in the world, and the only public building in recent years which approaches in dignity and grandeur the museums of the old world.\" By the twentieth century, the Museum had become one of the world's great art centers. The ancient Egyptian hippopotamus statuette that is now the Museum's unofficial mascot, \"William,\" entered the collection in 1917. Today, the Museum's collection includes nearly two million works of art, tens of thousands of which are on view in its 2.4-million-square-foot building along Fifth Avenue at any given time.\n\nThomas P. Campbell became the ninth director of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in January 2009, following the thirty-one-year tenure of Philippe de Montebello. Through fellowships and professional exchanges, ongoing excavation work, traveling exhibitions, and many other international initiatives, the Museum continues in the twenty-first century to fulfill its mission and serve the broadest possible audience.\n\nFor more about The Metropolitan Museum of Art visit: http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/history-of-the-museum/main-building\n",

    "description": "<b>80 Artists, 152 Artworks</b><br/>The Musei Capitolini date back to 1471, when Pope Sixtus IV donated to the people of Rome a group of bronze statues that until then had been kept at the Lateran. These statues constituted its original core collection. Various popes subsequently expanded the collection with works taken from excavations around Rome; some were moved from the Vatican, some, such as the Albani collection, were bought specifically for the museum. Around the middle of the eighteenth century, Pope Benedict XIV created a picture gallery. A considerable quantity of archaeological material was also added at the end of the nineteenth century when Rome became the capital of Italy and new excavations were carried out whilst creating two completely new districts were created for the expanding city.\nThe Museums' collections are displayed in the two of the three buildings that together enclose the Piazza del Campidoglio: Palazzo dei Conservatori and Palazzo Nuovo, the third being the Palazzo Senatorio. These two buildings are linked by an underground tunnel, which contains the Galleria Lapidaria and leads to the ancient Tabularium, whose monumental arches overlook the Forum.\nThe Palazzo Nuovo houses the collections of ancient sculpture made by the great noble families of the past. Their charming arrangement has remained substantially unchanged since the eighteenth century. They include the famous collections of busts of Roman philosophers and emperors, the statue of Capitoline Gaul, the Capitoline Venus, and the imposing statue of Marforio that dominates the courtyard.\nThe Conservators' Apartment contains the original architectural nucleus of the building, decorated with splendid frescoes portraying the history of Rome. The ancient Capitoline bronzes on display here add to the noble atmosphere: the Capitoline She-wolf, Spinario and the Capitoline Brutus.\nOn the first floor of the palace, a huge glass room, recently built, contains the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, which once stood in the Piazza del Campidoglio, and the imposing remains of the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter. A section is also dedicated to the most ancient part of the Campidoglio's history, from its first inhabitation until the construction of the sacred building, displaying the results of recent excavations. The halls that overlook the room contain works from the Horti of the Esquiline; the hall which connects the room to the apartments of the Palazzo dei Conservatori contains the Castellani collection, testimony to nineteenth century collecting practices.\nOn the second floor, the Capitoline Picture Gallery contains many important works, arranged in chronological order from late mediaeval times to the eighteenth century. The collection includes paintings by Caravaggio (Good Luck and St. John the Baptist), a massive canvas by Guercino (Burial of Saint Petronilla) and numerous paintings by Guido Reni and Pietro da Cortona.\nThe Palazzo Caffarelli-Clementino holds the numismatic collection, known as the Medagliere Capitolino. On display are many rare coins, medals, gems and jewels, as well as an area dedicated to temporary exhibitions.",

    "description": "<b>32 Artists, 51 Artworks</b><br/>In 1995, the Museo Art Nouveau y Art Deco was inaugurated to display the collection of decorative arts that another Salamanca local, Manuel Ramos Andrade, had bequeathed to his city.\nTo convert the building into a museum, Casa Lis underwent a thorough transformation of its decorative aspects. So the building was provided with leaded stained-glass windows, following the Catalan tradition of the houses of the Barcelona Eixample. Particularly noteworthy is the polychrome stained-glass ceiling that roofs the central patio, composed of over 2,000 pieces of leaded glass, designed by Ramos Andrade and created by the Catalan glazier, Juan Villaplana.\nThrough its nineteen collections, an exploration of its halls shows visitors a range of production from European decorative art workshops around 1900: jewellery by Masriera and Faberge; iridescent glass from the workshops of Lotz, Kralik, Pallme Konig or École de Nancy, including pieces by Emile Gallé, the Daum brothers and Paul Nicolas; furniture by Homar, Majorelle, Busquets; porcelain pieces by Rosenthal, Royal Copenhagen, Mariano Benlliure, Gustave Guetant and Zuloaga. The collections of which Casa Lis is the custodian illustrate the professional trajectory of authors as significant as Emile Gallé with his glass works of superimposed layers and his exquisite furniture, or the evolution of Rene Lalique who, starting out by designing Art Nouveau jewellery, subsequently orientated his creativity towards  glass design in the following decades.\nThe French porcelain doll collection from the 19th century is wonderful. It  is a collection that has been defined by experts as the greatest collection exhibited in public worldwide. Likewise, the exhibition of Chryselephantine sculpture, by Demetre Chiparus and Ferdinand Preiss among others, consists of small sculptures that combine metal for garments and marble for the naked parts of the body such as the face and hands. These have become emblematic of Art Deco.\n",

    "description": "<b>1 Artists, 105 Artworks</b><br/>Botero Museum of the Banco de la República\n\nIn the year 2000, Fernando Botero donated an art collection of 208 pieces to Banco de la República. 123 of these were his personal artwork and 85 were from his private collection of renowned international artists. Based on this collection, the Botero Museum was founded. The museum is located in the La Candelaria neighborhood, a historical section of Bogota, in a colonial house that until 1955 served as the office of the archbishop. The house was restored and adapted by Banco de la República to become a museum, under the guidance and curatorship of the master artist himself. As of the first of November, 2000, the collection has been available at no charge to the public every day, except on Tuesdays. \n\nDuring the opening of the Botero Museum, the artist said: “It is for me an infinite pleasure to know that these works of art belong to Colombia today; to know that the students that come into this building will be in touch with the most significant artistic pieces of our times, being able to contemplate, on a permanent basis, original artwork made by great masters; and to know that lovers of painting and sculpture can come visit this haven of peace and stroll quietly through the halls, allowing themselves to be enveloped by modern aesthetics.” \n\nIn the west wing of the museum are exhibited 123 pieces of art created by the master Botero himself. These consist of paintings, drawings and sculptures. The distinct characteristics of the artist’s work are present: his mastery of technique, the consistency of his vision, the creativity, the sensuality, the handling of volume, the unexpected attention to detail, and that combination of irony and respect that has been a signature in his approach to Colombian themes, as well as his references to universal painting. They are, primarily, works of the last decades of the 20th century that allow us to enjoy the language and style that has characterized the artist in his maturity.\n\nThe east wing of the Botero Museum exhibits 85 works of art of the highest caliber which show in full the evolution of modern painting and sculpture. The oldest piece is Gitane au tambourin (pre-1862) by Camille Corot, and the most recent piece is the great oil painting of Barceló (1998). This collection brings together such renowned artists as Picasso, Leger, Renoir, Monet, Dali, Giacometti, Beckmann, Freud, Calder, and Bacon, and has placed the Botero Museum among the five most important public international art collections in Latin America.\n\nEach day near a thousand people visit the Botero Museum. Among these are children, teachers, adults, and families, who can participate free of charge in educational programs offered daily by the Banco de la República in order to bring the public closer to this magnificent collection. A variety of activities, among them guided tours, lectures, conferences, and workshops for children as well as teachers, are offered, fulfilling the desire of the master Fernando Botero’s wishes for this collection: to be there forever, for the education and enjoyment of all the Colombian people.\n\nAs a newspaper expressed at the time, the donation by Fernando Botero was “the greatest gift that a Colombian has ever made to his country.”\n",

    "description": "<b>3 Artists, 37 Artworks</b><br/>Located in Xochimilco, at Mexico City's southern extreme, the Dolores Olmedo Museum is housed in a rambling stone structure, originally dating from the Sixteenth Century, formerly known as the Hacienda La Noria.\nBy donating her art collection to the people of Mexico, Dolores Olmedo Pati F1o (1908-2002) created a cohesive whole, where treasures of the fine arts were incorporated into colonial construction added during the Seventeenth Century, surrounded by lush gardens, shaded by singularly Mexican plant species, and inhabited by gorgeous animals like the magical peacocks--seemingly confected of living jewels and the enigmatic hairless Xoloiztcuintle dogs, a Precolumbian breed that is unique to behold and warm to the touch.\n\nSince the museum opened its doors to the public in September of 1994, its greatest treasure is its painting.  The world's most important collections of works by Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo are housed here permanently and are adored by the legions of visitors who flock to admire them.  There is, as well, a collection of the woodcuts and book illustrations by Russo-French painter Angelina Beloff, Rivera's companion during his early years as a budding painter in Europe.\n\nIn addition, a privileged display of over nine hundred archaeological pieces provides interest and contrast, as well as a glimpse of the aesthetic of a number among Mexico's diverse ancient cultures.  Gilded wooden figures from the Colonial period create another contrast.  And as evidence of Mexico's ever-vibrant creative imperative, a collection of popular art presents the largely-anonymous masterpieces of ceramic, wood, tin, lacquer, papier mache and copper, that village craftsman have produced for generations, and that still serve as the utensils and implements, as well as the ceremonial offerings, of their daily lives.",

The building, which dates to 1904, was not a large-scale construction. Today it has an 800 m2 building surrounded by property measuring 1200 m2. Diego and Frida filled it with color, folk art, and pre-Hispanic pieces to show their admiration for the peoples and cultures of Mexico. The construction underwent two major modifications. When Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky lived with Diego and Frida in 1937, the property today occupied by the garden was purchased. In 1946 Diego Rivera asked Juan O'Gorman to build Frida's studio. The interior of the house has been maintained virtually intact. This was respected by the poet and the couple's friend, Carlos Pellicer, who designed the museum display for the space after Frida's death. Therefore, the house and its contents preserve that intimate atmosphere.",

    "description": "<b>121 Artists, 225 Artworks</b><br/>National Museum of Art\n\nThe National Museum of Art (MUNAL), founded in 1982 and located in the historical center of Mexico City, hosts the most important collection of Mexican art in the country. The collection was created by merging the national stock the National Fine Arts Institute (INBA) had held since 1946, which, in turn, came from a variety of institutions, the Modern Art Museum, the San Carlos Museum, and the San Diego Viceregal Painting Gallery.\n\nAt present the MUNAL’s collection consists of more than 3,551 works, including among them magnificent exemplars of painting, sculpture, engraving and drawing, as well as folk art and photography, some of which are veritable masterpieces. Moreover, the museum hosts works from María Izquierdo, José María Velasco, Saturnino Herrán, Gerardo Murillo, Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros, seven of those nine artists whose works are considered to constitute an “Artistic Monument”.   \n\nThe outstanding collection of Viceregal art that is now in the National Museum of Art was assembled in two phases, the first lasting from 1982 to 1988, when the museum was founded, and the second as on 1999, when the collection of the San Diego Viceregal Painting Gallery became part of our museum’s stock. Thanks to that the MUNAL has become the depositary of the most important collection of colonial art in Mexico. \n\nThis collection dates back to 1783, when the Academy San Carlos was founded. In 1820, the collection of the aforesaid teaching institution was enriched by works originating from the recently closed establishments of the Hospitaller congregations. The collection continued to be extended by other works, from various convents, that ended up in the museum during the War of Independence, and also by those bought in 1843, when the Academy profited from the income it received from the National Lotery. The paintings that came from the convents that were closed down under the Reform promulgated by Benito Juarez in 1859 were also added to the Academy’s stock. \n\nNineteenth (19th) Century \n \nThe collected works of the nineteenth century cover representative examples of the art movement that was emerged in 1785 and prevailed throughout the 19th century. The most cultivated genres in this period were historic paintings, religious representations and, towards mid-century, national landscapes. The works originating from the academies and regional schools were indicative of the various influences and trends that had an impact on artists during this century, which was primordially a period devoted to the construction of ideologies and the building of a national identity. \n\nMoreover, a large part of the XIXth-century collection dates back to the foundation of the “Academy of San Carlos of the Three Noble Arts” in 1783. Another important date is 1843, the year in which the Academy San Carlos was reorganized by presidential decree, which the encouraged of works by its staff and students. The works that emerge from this institution, during the period from its reorganization until the early XXth century, are marked by neoclassical, romantic, realist and modernist influences, and feature mythological topics, political allegories, scenes from the Bible, incidents from Mexican and world history, landscapes, and urban and Costumbrista scenes, as well as pessimistic pieces reflecting fin-de-siècle awareness of the decline of civilization. \n\nTwentieth (20th) Century\n\nThese galleries are distinguished by the works of the unsurpassed advocates of Mexican art: Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros, as well as other artists that are interested in the recuperation of the indigenous vein as the foundation of the national art par excellence. Thus, the entire XXth –century collection- consists of 1533 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints and photographies  which pertain various schools, trends, styles and artists; as well as 436 works of representative artists who adhered to different visual and technical tenets.\n",

    "description": "<b>91 Artists, 234 Artworks</b><br/>The National Museum of Fine Arts\n\nThe Building\n\nThe National Museum of Fine Arts (MNBA) of Argentina is located on Avenida del Libertador 1473, Buenos Aires.\n\nIt was inaugurated on 25 December 1896 and the opening was attended by numerous personalities. Among them was Nicaraguan writer, Rubén Darío, a referent of modernity. Its first Director was Eduardo Schiaffino.\n\n\nThe Bon Marché on the Calle Florida, was the precursory site for Argentina’s first art museum and had been built to house a department store. The absence of public buildings undoubtedly led to the MNBA setting out in this commercial mall, built in the style of its namesake in Paris. \n\nIn 1910 MNBA moved to its second premises in the Plaza San Martin, a palace made of iron and glass that had served as the Argentine Pavilion at the 1889 Universal Exhibition in Paris and was shipped to Buenos Aires afterwards.\n\nSince 1932, the MNBA has had premises of its own in the old pump building of Obras Sanitarias in Recoleta. Though not originally built to house a museum, it was adapted for its new role by the architect Alejandro Bustillo. The building currently consists of thirty rooms distributed over three floors.\n\nThe Museum & its Permanent Rooms\n\nInternational Art: \n\nThe permanent rooms on the first floor are entirely devoted to international art dating from the Middle Ages to the 20th century. The MNBA’s collection is considered to be the most important of European art in South America, and includes works by Tintoretto, El Greco, Rembrandt, Zurbarán, Tiepolo and medieval masters. The amount of space dedicated to the 19th century in our collections denounces its relevance. It withholds paintings of Goya, the landscapes of Courbet, Millet, Troyon and Daubigny of the Barbizon School, as well as of their academic contemporaries such as Bouguereau and Lefebvre, the dawn of impressionism in Manet’s emblematic Nymph Surprised, the vibrant colour in the views of Pissarro, Monet and Sisley, the post-impressionist search in Van Gogh, Gauguin, Tolouse-Lautrec and Degas. It can be seen the valuable local contributions , as well as Italian painting, the Macchiaioli, the Spanish version of impressionism, and a thematic core devoted to various different manifestations of late 19th century European symbolism.\n\nThe last part of the tour through the permanent exhibition brings together various early 20th century avant-garde masters such as Klee, Kandinsky, De Chirico, Carrà, Modigliani, Picasso and Léger. Post-war trends are represented by European artists like Nicholson, Fontana, Vasarely, Dubuffet, Fautrier, Saura, Alechinsky and Henry Moore, while US section includes paintings by Rothko, Pollock and Nevelson.\n\n19th and 20th Century Argentine Art: The first floor is devoted to Argentine and Latin American art. Next to the room of pre-Columbian Andean art, is a room displaying the Panels of the Conquest of Mexico, an emblematic example of colonial art in the crossing of cultures. Also on this floor María Luisa Bemberg’s former collection incorporates the River Plate avant-gardes.\n\nExhibited as an extensive and comprehensive overview, the permanent exhibition of Argentine art offers a sequence ranging from the foreign painters who visited Argentina in the early 19th century to the latest artistic trends of the 20th century.\n",

    "description": "<b>43 Artists, 59 Artworks</b><br/><p>Founded in 1990 after originally being created as an art centre, Museo Reina Sofía is among the culminating events of the Spanish transition to democracy, recovering Pablo Picasso's Guernica as well as an outstanding representation of the international avant-gardes and neo-avant-gardes. In short, the founding of this museum means the recuperation of the experience of modernity previously missing from the Spanish context and the opportunity to try out new models of narration from a periphery that is neither lateral nor derivative, but is rather an entry way for new stories, historiographic models and artistic episodes that tip the balance of the orthodox canon of the main museums.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the Museo Reina Sofía program is three-fold: on the one hand, rethinking the function of the museum today; on the other hand, analysing the mechanisms for mediation between the public and the institution; and finally, proposing new contexts and stories through the collection and exhibits that lead to a new notion of modernity.</p>\n\n<p>The institution no longer considers its task to be simply the transmission of culture. Instead, it works with other agents and institutions, creating networks and alliances that strengthen the public sphere and position Museo Reina Sofía as a reference of prime importance in the geopolitical South. Similarly, the public is no longer conceived of as a homogenous and uniform multitude, but rather as a collective, multiple agent that questions, rejects and forms opinions, that builds, so to speak, its relationship with the Museum through the singularity of the artistic experience. </p>",

In the nearly one thousand works on display, visitors can contemplate the major periods and pictorial schools of western art such as the Renaissance, Mannerism, the Baroque, Rococo, Romanticism and the art of the 19th and 20th centuries up to Pop Art. The museum also features works from some movements not represented in state-owned collections, such as Impressionism, Fauvism, German Expressionism and the experimental avant-garde movements of the early 20th century. In addition, it boasts an important collection of 19th-century American painting not found in any other European museum institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from its panoramic perspective, the collection housed in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum also offers us a glimpse of the tastes and preferences of the two persons principally responsible for its existence, Baron Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza (1875-1947) and Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza (1921-2002). Well versed in the Central European artistic tradition, both men showed a particular predilection for portraits and landscapes. This is evident in the works of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, in contrast with the predominance of religious and historical paintings found in other Spanish museums.

Names such as Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, Piet Mondrian, Joan Miró, Max Ernst, Vieira da Silva, Francis Bacon, Andy Warhol, Donald Judd and Bruce Nauman, among many others, are presented within the framework of the artistic movements, which their works allowed to define through a chronological succession that enables the spectator to take a trip through the period in question. On the first exhibit area, the visitor can find a section devoted to the earlier historic avant-garde movements such as Cubist Space, Dadaism, Constructivisms, Surrealism, Informalism and Pop Art. On the second exhibit area, the continuation of the route through the second half of the twentieth century through to the present day will be marked out, presenting Minimalism, Conceptualism, Arte Povera, as well as a range of approaches that have come to construct the present.

In 1849 the lawyer Boijmans left his art collection to the city of Rotterdam. With the acquisition of the Van Beuningen collection in 1958 the museum got the second part of its name. The museum houses a unique collection of paintings, sculptures and everyday objects. The collection of prints and drawings is one of the best in the world. The museum also organises a diverse programme of spectacular temporary exhibitions throughout the year.\nOld and modern masters\n\nMarvel at the beautiful works by Bruegel the Elder and Rembrandt. Follow the development of Impressionism and Modernism in the paintings of Monet, Van Gogh and Mondriaan. Lose yourself in the dream world of the Surrealists Dalí and Magritte. And the art is not only inside: the museum has a wonderful view of the sculpture garden.\nContemporary art and design\n\nThe museum shows how everyday objects have changed over the last eight hundred years, from medieval jugs and glassware from Holland’s Golden Age to Rietveld furniture and contemporary Dutch design. A young generation of visual artists such as Eliasson and Cattelan bring the museum’s art collection up to date.\nStately beacon\n\nThe museum’s monumental building opened in 1935. It was designed by the municipal architect Van der Steur specially to house the collection. The stately redbrick building contains both large galleries where art can be viewed in daylight and more intimate spaces. The building survived the bombing of the city in 1940 and has been extended several times over the years. To this day the building’s tower remains a beacon in the city.\n\nThe Collection\nIn Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen exhibitions and the collection each have their own\nwing. The collections building contains extensive displays from the museum’s own\ncollection. The chronological displays feature art from the late Middle Ages to the present\nday, punctuated with several thematic accents. The displays, featuring masterpieces\nfrom the collection, are changed every three years. The tour begins on the first floor with\nmainly painting and sculpture and continues on the ground floor with mainly decorative\narts and design. Throughout the building are galleries where contemporary artists make\ninterventions that give the visitor a little ‘wake-up’.\n\nThrough variations in shape, format and atmosphere, the collections building from 1935,\ndesigned the municipal architect Ad van der Steur, creates an environment in which the\nvisitor can enjoy the art works at their best. The designer and stylist Maarten Spruyt has\nenhanced this through his sensitive hanging and varied application of colour. His\ninstallations do justice to the architecture of the Van der Steur building, partly by creating\nspots where no art is displayed, thus freeing the architecture from its purely functional\nrole.\n\nThe Museum’s Architecture\nThe museum comprises three wings, each with its own function and character:\n\nThe Collections Building, 1935\nThe collections building was designed by the municipal architect Adriaan van der Steur\n(1893-1953). He and Dirk Hannema (1895- 1984), the museum director who\ncommissioned the new building, shared a common goal: the new museum building\nshould be a place where people could come to enjoy art. It must set itself apart from the\noutdated seventeenth-century Schielandshuis, where the museum’s collection had\npreviously been housed, with its overcrowded walls and poor lighting. It must be a\nmodern building fit for its purpose. To this end, extensive experiments with an ingenious\noverhead-lighting system were carried out in a temporary structure on the building site.\nMuch attention was paid to the formats of the galleries and to their subtle detailing. Van\nder Steur was inspired by the domestic interiors of private collectors and thus opted\nprimarily for small, intimate spaces. Indeed, many of the works of art in the museum’s\ncollection had come from such surroundings. Sightlines, variations in the size and shape\nof the galleries, and the alternation of galleries with spaces in which the visitor could rest\nand enjoy the surrounding park were designed to avoid tiring the visitor. Despite the fact\nthat many modernist architects were active in Rotterdam at the time, the City opted for a\nmore conservative style of architecture and for traditional materials such as brick, natural\nstone and copper. The stately entrance, marked by a tower, was typical of this\narchitectural approach and the prevailing conception of a museum. In the evening a\nlantern illuminated the top of the tower, ensuring that the museum was a prominent\nlandmark in the city by night as well as by day.\n\nThe Temporary Exhibitions Building, 1972 - 2003\nThe building for temporary exhibitions was designed by the architect Alexander Bodon\n(1906-1993) and was opened in 1972. The dynamic of a programme of constantly\nhanging exhibitions gives this wing an entirely different character. But it also has another\nambience: no subtle detailing, just three enormous flexible spaces, which can be\nreorganised according to the needs of each exhibition. Bodon realised his ‘new wing’ in a\nperiod in which modern art demanded more space, both literally and figuratively. The\ngalleries are white and have diffuse toplighting. Bodon excluded anything that might steal\nour attention from the works of art on display, with the exception of the large window that\naffords a splendid view of the garden. In 2003 the Belgian architectural practice\nRobbrecht & Daem extended the Exhibitions Building with a series of new galleries that \nencircle the large galleries of the Bodon wing. The new spaces make use of clear and\nfrosted glass, concrete and occasional vestiges of existing brick walls. Together with the\nhandsome library facing the street, this is the most recent expansion of the museum’s\naccommodation.\n\nThe pavilion, 1991\nThe pavilion designed by Hubert-Jan Henket (1940) is a freestanding element to the\nsouth of the Collections Building. It was designed specially for the Van Beuningen-de\nVriese Collection that was donated to the museum in 1981. This collection of pre-\nindustrial domestic artefacts is displayed in the basement gallery. Its enclosed character\nis in marked contrast to the highly transparent nature of the ground- floor space with its\nextensive use of glass and its silver-coloured steel roof construction. In this space, which\nprovides a wonderful location for the restaurant, you are always aware of the museum’s\ngarden that was laid out in the 1930s.\n\nWhat’s in a name?\nA small mediaeval travelling altar, a double steel cage by the contemporary American\nartist Bruce Nauman, an exquisite chased silver salt cellar dating from 1613 and a\ntubular steel chair produced some three-hundred years later - these are just a few of the\nmore than 140,000 artefacts in Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen’s rich collections. The\ncollections are striking in their diversity, housing old master and modern paintings\nalongside product design and the applied arts, and encompassing the full range of media\nfrom painting and sculpture, prints and drawings to photography, video and film. There\nare unique pieces and items that have been mass produced in their hundreds, thousands\nor even millions. This diversity, which sets Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen’s collection\napart from the other great Dutch museums, was already a feature of the museum in its\ninfancy around 1850. Since its establishment the museum’s history has been shaped in a\ncritical way by he activities of private collectors, two of whom have furnished the\ninstitution with its doublebarrelled name. The Utrecht-born lawyer F.J.O. Boijmans\nbequeathed his collection to the City of Rotterdam in 1847, so laying the museum’s\nfoundations. In 1958 the museum acquired the collection of the shipping magnate D.G.\nvan Beuningen, also a native of Utrecht. This was such a milestone that the museum’s\nname was changed to Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. The museum is indebted to\nmany other private collectors, whose varied interests have informed its diverse\ncollections and whose passion means that ours is the only museum in the Netherlands\nthat contains paintings by the Van Eyck brothers, Titian, Bosch, Bruegel the Elder, Dalí\nand Magritte. In the post-war period the museum has had increasing funds to pursue its\nown acquisitions policy, but it continues to profit from the generosity of private collectors.\nIn 1981 Mr and Mrs Van Beuningen-de Vriese endowed the museum with a vast\ncollection of pre-industrial domestic artefacts and the museum has recently benefited\nfrom its partnership with H+F Patronage in acquiring an outstanding installation by the\nDanish-born Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson.\n\nF.J.O. Boijmans Frans Jacob Otto Boijmans\n1767 – 1847\nF.J.O. Boijmans was an avid collector of paintings, drawings, prints and porcelain.\nIndeed he often allowed his appetite for quantity to overshadow his eye for quality. When\nthe City of Rotterdam took charge of his collection in 1847, it immediately sold many\npieces because of their poor quality. Another considerable portion of the collection was\nlost in a fire at the museum in 1864 with the result that only 127 paintings remain from\nBoijmans’ original collection. The confident ‘self-portrait’ by Carel Fabritius is one of its\nundoubted highlights. \n\nDaniël George van Beuningen\n1877 – 1955\nThe shipping magnate D.G. van Beuningen was one of the members of Rotterdam’s elite\nupon whom the museum could rely for financial support for important acquisitions in the\n1920s and 1930s. Van Beuningen also amassed his own large collection of master\npieces including Bruegel’s famous painting The Tower of Babel. Following his death in\n1955, his heirs offered the collection to the museum on the condition that the City of\nRotterdam pay the inheritance tax. Thus the museum gained 189 paintings, 17 drawings,\n30 sculptures, 5 pieces of silverware and the second part of its double-barrelled name.\n\nThree masterpieces from the collection:\nfrom collector to museum\n\nWhen works of art are shown at their best in a museum – carefully placed and lit – it is as\nif they have always belonged here. However, their presence in the museum should not\nbe taken for granted. The art works in the collection have come from far and wide.\nSometimes the road from the studio to the museum was long, sometimes short, but in\neach case the works have reached their destination through a combination of\ncoincidence and bold vision, good management and well-exploited opportunities. Many\nof the art works have a fascinating story to tell.\n\nHieronymus Bosch (c.1450-1516)\nThe Pedlar (detail), 1490-1505\noil on panel, 71 x 70.6 cm\nacquired 1931\nSometimes the acquisition of a work of art is a question of sleepless nights, patience and\ndetermination. That was certainly the case with The Pedlar by Hieronymus Bosch. The painting\ncame up for auction in Berlin in 1930. The museum’s director at the time, Dirk Hannema, was intent\nupon purchasing it for the museum but faced competition from the Alte Pinakothek in Munich.\nHowever, neither museum had the required sum of 385,000 German marks. Hannema convinced the\nDutch art dealer Jacques Goudstikker (1897-1940) to buy the painting privately and to reserve it for\nhim. A year of fundraising amongst private benefactors ensued. Sometimes Hannema was given a\nfrosty reception, for example by the chairman of Royal Dutch Shell, Sir Henri Deterding (1866-1939),\nwho had no intention of, “making a gift of this ugly tramp,” and who said he had something better up\nhis sleeve for the museum. Hannema eventually succeeded in raising the necessary funds and the\nmuseum acquired the painting in 1931. In 1936, a year after the opening of the new museum\nbuilding, Hannema organised a major exhibition of works by Hieronymus Bosch and the Northern\nNetherlandish Primitives. The Pedlar, which was then known as The Prodigal Son, functioned as the\nicon for what was one of the first ‘blockbuster’ exhibitions in the Netherlands.\n\nPieter Bruegel the Elder (c. 1525-1569)\nThe Tower of Babel, c.1565\noil on panel, 59.9 x 74.6\nacquired 1958\nThe Tower of Babel underwent an extraordinary journey from the moment it left Bruegel’s studio\nmore than 440 years ago until its arrival in the museum in 1958. We are still able to trace its steps\nfor part of this journey. Around 1600 the painting was in the collection of Rudolf II in Prague. The\nHoly Roman Emperor was a great admirer of Bruegel and had several paintings by the artist. It may\nhave been stolen shortly after this date by Swedish soldiers and came into the possession of Queen\nChristina of Sweden. By 1620 the painting had certainly made its way to Antwerp. We know from a\nseal on the reverse of the panel that a century later it was in the hands of Elisabeth of Parma, the\nsecond wife of King Philip V of Spain. Thereafter the thread is lost until the painting resurfaced on\nthe Parisian art market in 1935. The following year the collector D.G. van Beuningen bought the\npainting for the vast sum of 120,000 guilders. He gave it a place in the living room above the stove, \non which, according to his children, he would fry himself an egg on Sundays. The painting was\nacquired by the museum together with the majority of Van Beuningen’s collection in 1958.\n\nRembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669)\nTitus at his Desk (detail), 1655\noil on canvas, 77 x 63 cm\nacquired 1939\nIn the years between 1910 and 1940 the collection grew in spectacular fashion, both in terms of\nquantity and quality, mainly due to the efforts of the museum’s director Dirk Hannema. Time and\nagain he managed to motivate collectors to support the museum and thus, in his words: “to achieve\nsomething of lasting value for the community.” Some of these patrons were reluctant to give money\nto a state-funded institution such as Museum Boijmans for political reasons. One of these was the\nshipping magnate Willem van der Vorm (1873-1957), to whom Hannema often turned for support.\nVan der Vorm was instrumental in establishing a private foundation dedicated to the museum’s\ngrowth. The foundation’s first acquisition, immediately after its establishment in 1939, was a recently\ndiscovered painting by Johannes Vermeer entitled Christ at Emmaus. Despite critical approval from\nthe art-historical profession, the painting was later exposed as a forgery. The Foundation’s second\npurchase that same year has remained an undisputed highlight of the collection: the much sought\nafter portrait of Rembrandt’s son Titus was acquired with additional support from the Rembrandt\nSociety and ‘120 friends of the museum’.\n\n",

The tour around the museum provides a wide-ranging insight into the fascinating world of folk art and presents an abundance of old traditions as well as more recent and contemporary works that straddle the boundary between everyday life and art: enchanting carved objects from the Ore Mountains and embroidered woven textiles from Lusatia, lavish Sorb costumes and intricate lace from the Vogtland region, painted furniture, richly decorated ceramics and an unusually diverse collection of historic toys. Whatever their age, anyone who would like to explore the rich heritage of Saxon folk art, will find a unique exhibition here.\nThe Puppentheatersammlung (Puppet Theatre Collection) on the upper floor is one of the largest and most important collections of its kind in the world. Here you can immerse yourself in the poetic, dramatic, magical and comic world of historic puppet theatre. The collection’s holdings range from 200-year-old marionettes and fairground hand puppets to Bauhaus theatre figures and items from contemporary puppet theatre. Among the most valuable exhibits are figures and theatre sets from several 19th-century mechanical world theatres. No other European museum has objects of this quality and diversity.\n\nMuseum für Sächsische Volkskunst mit Puppentheatersammlung (Museum of Saxon Folk Art and Puppet Theatre Collection) is part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) that are among the most prominent museums in the world. The combined holdings of the twelve museums offer the visitor a remarkable thematic diversity. These museums originated from the collections of the Saxon electors and Polish kings. They systematically developed cabinets of curiosities, which were accessible to select circles in their day and still form the core of the wonderful art treasures of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden today. The collections are situated in world famous buildings such as the Residenzschloss (Royal Palace), the Zwinger, and the Semperbau (Semper Building), which are among the most important sights in Dresden.",

    "description": "<b>204 Artists, 303 Artworks</b><br/>The collection, the collections – Five museums under a single roof\nThe history of the  Museum Kunstpalast started with the patronage of artists and the arts by Elector Johann Wilhelm von der Pfalz (1658-1716) who founded one of the quasi-public European painting galleries. It transitioned through to a Municipal Art Museum, and from the latter’s foundation through to its incorporation as an entity under private law at the end of the last century. In 2001, the institution re-opened as the first public-private partnership in Germany in the field of museums, the partners being the City of Düsseldorf, E.ON AG (formerly VEBA AG), the Metro Group and Degussa. \nThe presentation of the collection illustrates over an area of 5,500 m²  the variety of the five collections in the Museum Kunstpalast, one of the few institutions in the Rhineland to accommodate important collections of paintings, sculpture, graphic works, glass, crafts and new media under one roof. \nThe high points of the collection include the Rubens Gallery with the paintings “The Assumption of the Virgin” and “Venus and Adonis” by the gallery’s eponym, as well as other painters active at the court of Elector Jan Wellem, such as Frans van Douven and the aforementioned sculptor Grupello. The Rubens Gallery will be supplemented by a Decoratori Gallery with exhibits from the collection of Baroque oil sketches.\nA further strength of the collection is the field of 18th and 19th-century painting which has been extended in recent years with new acquisitions such as the “Portrait of the Improvisation Virtuoso Teresa Bandettini-Landucci of Lucca” by Angelika Kauffmann, which will now being presented here for the first time.\nOther highlights will be the artist rooms - designed by the artists themselves - such as Nam June Paik, who attached his multimonitor installation “Fish Flies on Sky” (1983–1985) beneath one of the ceilings, or the room with works by Joseph Beuys, or the ZERO-Lichtraum, set up jointly by Heinz Mack, Otto Piene and Günter Uecker at the documenta in Kassel in 1964 as a homage to Fontana, and a permanent part of the museum’s collection  since the 1970s. \nAnother unique element of the Museum’s collection are the legendary “Creamcheese” (1967–1977) and Thomas Schütte’s room installation “Furniture for ‘One Man Houses’” (2005), which in 2010 was given to the museum on permanent loan from the collection of the Stadtsparkasse Düsseldorf.\nThe newly displayed galleries will also allow the public to see a number of newly acquired and freshly restored works as well as new permanent loans: for example “Large Head with Small Man” (2010) by Stephan Balkenhol recently loaned to the collection. \n\n",

    "description": "<b>1 Artists, 100 Artworks</b><br/>The existence of the National Museum begins with the establishment of a set of named Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen, founded by the Dutch Government on 24 April 1778. At that time in central European intellectual revolution (the Age of Enlightenment), which is where people begin to develop scientific thinking and science. In 1752 in Haarlem, the Netherlands stood De Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen (Dutch Scientific Society). This encourages the Dutch in Batavia (Indonesia) to establish a similar organization.\n\nBataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen (BG) is an independent institution established for the purpose of advancing penetitian in the field of arts and sciences, especially in the areas of biological sciences, physics, archeology, literature, ethnology and history, also publish research hash. This institution has the slogan \"Ten Nutte van het Algemeen\" (To the Public Interest).\n\nOne of the founders of this institution, namely JCM Radermacher, donated a house he owns in Jalan Kalibesar, a Jakarta-trade zone in the City. Except that he also donated a number of collections of cultural objects and books are very useful, donations Radermacher which is the embryo of the founding of museums and libraries.\n\nDuring the period of British rule in Java (1811-1816), Lieutenant Governor Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles became director of this association. Because homes in Kalibesar is full with a collection of the Raffles ordered the construction of a new building for use as a museum and meeting rooms for the Literary Society (formerly called the building \"Societeit de Harmonie\"). Now in this place stood the State Secretariat building complex, near the presidential palace.\n\nThe number of collections belonging to the BG continues neningkat in Jalan Majapahit museum can no longer accommodate his collection. In 1862, Dutch East Indies government decided to build a new museum building in a location that is now, namely Jalan Merdeka Barat No. 12 (also called Koningsplein West ). The land covers an area that later on it was built buildings Rechst Hogeschool or \"College of the Law\" (never used for Kenpetai headquarters during the Japanese occupation, and now the Ministry of Defence and Security).This new museum building opened to the public in 1868.\n\nThe museum is very well known among the Indonesian people, especially residents of Jakarta. They called it \"Elephant Building\" or \"Elephant Museum\" because the front page of the museum there is a bronze elephant statue gift from King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) from Thailand who visited the museum in 1871. Sometimes also called \"Building Arca\" because in the building was and still is stored various types and forms of statues from different periods.\n\nIn 1923 this association received the title of \"Royal\" for his services in the field of scientific and government so that the full project into the Royal Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen. On January 26, 1950, the Royal Genootschap van Kunsten en Bataviaasch Wetenschappen changed its name to the Institute of Culture of Indonesia. These changes are adjusted to the conditions at that time, as reflected in his new motto: \"to promote cultural sciences are useful to increase knowledge about the islands of Indonesia and surrounding countries.\"\n\nGiven the importance of this museum for the people of Indonesia, on 17 September 1962 the Cultural Institute of Indonesia, presented the museum management to the Indonesian government, which later became the Central Museum. Finally, based on the Decree of the Minister of Education and Culture, No.092 / 0 / 1979 dated 28 May 1979, the Museum Center upgraded to the National Museum.\n\nNow the National Museum of shelter under the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. The National Museum has a vision that refers to the vision of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of \"The realization of the National Museum as a center of culture and tourism information are capable of the intellectual life of the nation, increases the pride of civilization and national culture, and to strengthen unity and friendship among nations\".\n",

    "description": "<b>6 Artists, 11 Artworks</b><br/>Whether it is the medal struck to celebrate the birth of August the Strong’s sole legitimate heir, or the splendid silver and gold medals presented by kings to worthy personages after victories in military conflicts, or coins from ancient times that were used for trading purposes: every coin, every medal, every historical bond is associated with some aspect of world and cultural history and thus bears testimony to a particular epoch or event.\n\nThe broad spectrum of the Münzkabinett(Coin Cabinet) extends from classical antiquity to the present day. Its holdings comprise nearly 300,000 objects, making it one of the largest universal collections in Europe. Furthermore, the 30,000 Saxon coins and medals represent important periods in the history of Saxony. As well as coins and medals, the collection also comprises orders and insignia, bank notes and historic bonds, models, seals, minting dies for coins and medals, as well as minting machines and equipment.\nInterested visitors can study the subject in depth in the specialist library containing 30,000 volumes, or they can work in the study hall and gain fascinating insights into the history of coins, currency and artistic design. The Münzkabinett (Coin Cabinet) is presenting special exhibitions of items from among its holdings in the Hausmannsturm of the Residenzschloss (Royal Palace), which is open in the summer months.\n\nThe Münzkabinett (Coin Cabinet) is part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) that are among the most prominent museums in the world. The combined holdings of the twelve museums offer the visitor a remarkable thematic diversity. These museums originated from the collections of the Saxon electors and Polish kings. They systematically developed cabinets of curiosities, which were accessible to select circles in their day and still form the core of the wonderful art treasures of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden today. The collections are situated in world famous buildings such as the Residenzschloss (Royal Palace), the Zwinger, and the Semperbau (Semper Building), which are among the most important sights in Dresden.",

    "description": "<b>6 Artists, 142 Artworks</b><br/>The National Museum, New Delhi as we see it today in the majestic building on the corner of Janpath and Maulana Azad Road is the prime museum in the country. The blue-print for establishing the National Museum in Delhi had been prepared by the Gwyer Committee set up by the Government of India in 1946. When an Exhibition of Indian Art consisting of selected artefacts from various museums of India, sponsored by the Royal Academy (London) with the co-operation of the Government of India and Britain, was on display in the galleries of Burlington House, London during the winter months of 1947-48, it was decided to display the same collection under a single roof in Delhi before the return of exhibits to their respective museums. Accordingly, the exibition was held in the state rooms of the Rashtrapati Bhawan, New Delhi in 1949, and it turned out to be a great success. In turn, the event proved responsible for the creation of National Museum. On the auspicious day of the 15th August, 1949, the National Museum was formally inaugurated by the Governor-General of India, Shri R.C. Rajagopalachari, and it was announced that till a permanent building for housing the National Musuem was constructed, the Museum would continue to function in the Rashtrapati Bhawan. The Government also felt to retain the exhibits on show to form the holdings of the National Museum and the plan was sent to all the participants of London exhibition. It continued to be looked after well by the Director General of Archaeology until the Ministry of Education, the Government of India declared it a separate institution to grow in its collections that were sought painstakingly. It received several gifts but artefacts were collected mainly through its Art Purchase Committee. In the meanwhile, the foundation of the present building was laid by Pt. J.L. Nehru, Prime Minister of India, in the 12th May, 1955 and the new building where works of art were displayed elegantly on scientific lines, was handed over to Museum authorities in June, 1960. The Museum was formally thrown open to the public on December 18, 1960. And it is now within the administrative control and fully financed by the Department of Culture, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India. The Museum has in its possession approximately 2,00,000 works of exquisite art of diverse nature, both Indian and foreign and its holdings cover a time span of more than five thousand years of our cultural heritage. While the splendid chronological display of selected art objects in the various galleries, screening of educational films related to art and culture, guided tours, gallery talks by the experts, special lectures and training programmes, facilities for photography and access to the reserve collection and library for the study, and advice on identification of art objects have brought immense laurels to the Museum. The conservation laboratory had made its existence felt even in other countries.",

Development of the Museum is closely connected to the social changes of modern China. Thirteen years after the founding of the Republic of China, the last Qing Emperor Puyi was exiled from the Forbidden City. The cultural artifacts left within the palaces were collectively itemized, and a National Palace Museum was born.\n\nAiming to preserve the imperial collections and palatial treasures from the various Chinese dynasties, the National Palace Museum was officially open on October 10, 1925, allowing members of the public and future generations to enter the Palace to admire this cultural inheritance. Yi Pei-Ji (1880~1937) was appointed the first Director of the Museum, and the period from 1925~1931 marked the beginning of the National Palace Museum in Beijing.\n\nCultural Artifacts' Move to the South\n1931 marked the September 18 Crisis, when the Japanese army invaded Northorn China. In order to ensure the safety of the Museum's collections, the Executive Directors of the National Palace Museum gave orders to store important artifacts in crates so as to be ready for evacuation at any time. By January 1933 the situation in Northern China had reached a critical point when the Japanese army entered Shanhaiguan. On January 31, 1934, five groups of artifacts totaling 19,557 pieces were boxed and relocated southwards, including the 6,066 crates of objects from the Exhibition Office of Ancient Artifacts, the Yiheyuan and the Hanlin Yuan Imperial Academy. In February 1934 the Nationalist Government promulgated the \"National Palace Museum in Beijing Provisional Organization Statute\", which appointed the Executive Yuan as the authority over the Museum, and appointed Ma-Heng (1881~1955) as Director of the Museum. During this period, the Museum began to separate items that were to be relocated to Shanghai and ones to remain in Beijing. In 1935 a group of treasured works from the Palace Museum's collection was sent to London for the \"International Exhibition of Chinese Art\". In December of 1936 the Nanjing Branch of the Palace Museum was inaugurated, and the objects in Shanghai were once again moved to the newly-constructed treasury within the Taoist monastery Chaotian Gong of Nanjing.\n\nAfter the fall of Sung-hu front in 1937, the Executive Yuan ordered that artifacts from the Nanjing Branch to be moved westwards by water via southern, central and northern routes. The first group was comprised of 80 crates, mostly of which had been exhibited at the \"International Exhibition of Chinese Art\" in London; these had traveled by the so-called southern route of Wuhan, Changsha, Guiyang, Anshun to Baxian in Sichuan; the central route was comprised of 9,331 crates, traveling from Hankou, Yichang, Chongqing, Yibin finally to Anguxiang Lusoshan in Sichuan. The third group had traveled north via the Jinpu Railway to Xuzhou, then via the Longhai Railway to Baoji, and from there trucks carried the precious 7,287 crates of cargo through Hanzhong to Chengdu, finally arriving in Emei, Sichuan.\n\nThe primary duties of the National Palace Museum during wartime were to protect and preserve the collection, although it still managed to organize a number of exhibitions. In July 1937 the National Palace Museum selected 10 Shang and Zhou Period bronze artifacts, 40 jade artifacts, 48 paintings and calligraphy works, one silk tapestry from the Song and Yuan Dynasties respectively, and sent the total of one hundred selected pieces to Moscow and Leningrad for the \"Exhibition of Chinese Art\". When this group of artifacts was returned in December 1942, they were sent to the \"Third National Art Exhibition\" held in Chongqing before being returned to the Anshun Treasury. The Anshun collection was also displayed in the painting and calligraphy exhibition held by the Chongqing Central Library, as well as the Guizhou Art Gallery Exhibition in Guiyang in December 1943.\n\nAnother source of the National Palace Museum collection was the artifacts displayed at the Exhibition Office of Ancient Artifacts in Beijing. A \"Preparatory Office of the National Central Museum\" was set up in Nanjing in 1933 to preserve this collection, and when the situation in Nanjing became dangerous in November 1937, crates of cultural relics from the Preparatory Office of the National Central Museum were shipped westwards to Chongqing via a river route. They were then shipped to Kunming and Loshan in 1939, until finally arriving in Nan-xi in Szechuan. When Japan surrendered in August 1945, all of the Chinese cultural relics that were relocated could finally be shipped back to Nanjing.\n\nCrossing the Seas to Taiwan\nIn autumn 1948 fighting between the Nationalist and Communist armies took an adverse turn, and the Central Government made the decision to send the most precious objects in the collections of the Palace Museum and the Preparatory Office to Taiwan. Also making the move were documents and files from the collections of the National Central Library, Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Education. The first group of crates were carried by the navy from Nanjing, arriving in Keelung at the end of 1948; the second and third groups of crates also arrived the following year. A total of 2,972 crates were shipped; while these accounted for only 22% of the items originally transported south from Beijing and 852 crates of the items from the Preparatory Office, these pieces represented the cream of the collections.\n\nAfter arriving in Taichung, the government created the \"Joint Managerial Office of the National Central Museum\", which oversaw the artifacts and staff from the National Palace Museum, Preparatory Office of the National Central Museum, and National Central Library. The Ministry of Education was appointed the competent authority over the Joint Managerial Office, and Minister Han Li-wu (1902~1991) also acted as the Chief Commissioner. The Office then began building a vault in Beikou in the township of Wufeng, Taichung County, to store the collection, and an inventory of the collections and comprehensive cataloging work were undertaken. \"The Collection of Chinese Artifacts\" series was published. In 1957 the Exhibition Office at Beikou was officially open to the public, and in May 1961 the Office was invited to organize a major exhibition on the theme of \"Chinese Art Treasures\" that circulated in Washington, New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco in the United States for a year; 50 choice pieces were also selected to participate in the New York World Expo.\n\nIn 1965 a new museum was built in the Taipei suburb of Waishuanxi, and \"Regulations for the Provisional Board of Directors of the National Palace Museum\" were promulgated by the Executive Yuan, which appointed Mr. Wang Yun-wu (1888~1979) as the Chief Commissioner and Dr. Chiang Fu-tsung (1898~1990) as the Director. The new museum site was christened the \"Chung-Shan Museum\" in honor of the founding father of the nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and first opened to the public on the centenary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday.\n\nExpansions of the Museum\nIn addition to richness in collection, it is even more important for a museum to offer an excellent preservation environment and methods of maintenance, as well as research staff to organize educational exhibitions. For these reasons the National Palace Museum underwent several reorganizations and expansions of staff since its reopening at Waishuanxi, along with five structural expansions, before reaching its current scale.\n\nThere were many tasks to accomplish when the Museum reopened in 1965. The Museum offered 16 display rooms and 8 galleries, exhibiting calligraphy works, renowned paintings, bronze relics, porcelains, jade artifacts, curios, tapestries, rare books and documents. Large numbers of visitors passed through these display rooms every day. The \"National Palace Museum Bulletin\" and \"National Palace Museum Quarterly\" began circulating in 1966; in January 1967 a new memorial arch entitled \"One World for All\" and a chronology of China and occidental events were added to the central walkway; the extensions to the left and right wings of the new museum were also completed at the end of the year (Stage I Extensions). As the Museum began its operations, the original organizational scale and staff were both inadequate. In order to better accommodate its functions, the Museum issued new organizational regulations, expanding its existing Antiquities, Paintings and Calligraphies departments into 3 professional departments: Antiquities, Paintings and Calligraphies, and Rare Books and Documents in 1968, with three separate administrative sections of Exhibitions, Publications and Registration, to re-itemize, reorganize and archive the cultural artifacts, as well as undertaking exchanges with other academic institutions. The Library of the Museum was also opened to the public on the same year. A Scientific Preservation Technology Office was subsequently established in 1970, which completed a large portion in the organization of the Museum. In 1971 the second stage of expansions was completed, extending two wings of the new museum further to the front.\n\nDr. Chiang Fu-tsung was Director of the National Palace Museum for 18 years, leading the Museum through two expansions, reorganizations and additions of staff, firmly establishing the National Palace Museum to reach a scale appropriate for a modern museum. All museum-related works were carried out, and many journals, specialty books, catalogues, painting scrolls, and hand scrolls were published as time progressed. The Museum actively selected suitable personnel for overseas training, study trips and international symposiums, participating in the \"International Expo\" held in Osaka in 1970 and holding the \"Chinese Ancient Paintings Symposium\", which were not only well-received but also enhanced the international reputation of the National Palace Museum. In order to nurture a new generation of researchers and pass on the rich cultural experience and tradition of the existing staff, a number of the professional staff at the Museum assisted the National Taiwan University in opening a division on Chinese art history in its Graduate School of History in 1971, establishing a basis for research of Taiwanese art history. In order to fulfill its mission of writing a history of the dynasties, the Museum collaborated with the Academia Historica in editing and annotating the \"Draft History of the Qing Dynasty\" in 1978; \"Annotations to the Draft History of the Qing Dynasty\" was published by the Academia Historica twelve years later (1980).\n\nMoving into the International Arena\nIn 1983 Dr. Chiang Fu-tsung resigned due to illness, and Dr. Chin Hsiao-yi (1921~2007) took over as the new Director of the Museum. Having been a member of the National Palace Museum Managerial Committee for many years, Dr. Chin was very familiar with Museum affairs, and implemented many proactive initiatives as soon as he took office, including: publishing of the \"National Palace Museum Monthly\", \"National Palace Museum Academic Quarterly\", collaborating with the Taiwan Commercial Publications in publishing Wen Yuan Ge's \"Si Ku Quan Shu\", accepting the donation of Zu Xi-shu's \"Yi Xi Ci\" by Mr. Lin Zhong-yi (a Japanese-Chinese, 1923~2007), accepting the donation of \"Mo-jeh Ching-she\", and establishing the system of \"limited access and limited exhibition\" regulations. The third stage of the expansions with construction of the Administrative Building was completed in 1984, which greatly improved the storage space and environment for the artifacts, as well as greatly expanded the exhibition space. Temperature and humidity controls were installed, along with measures to counter fire and earthquakes, as well as a 24-hour security and monitoring system.\n\nIn 1985 the narrative display unit \"Relationship between Chinese and World Cultures\" was opened, increasing the knowledge of visitors to oriental and occidental cultures; new technologies were introduced, along with a multimedia display room; a series of academic events were held to celebrate the Museum's 60th anniversary. Dr. Chin also placed great importance on the social educational function of the National Palace Museum. Besides giving guided tours to 500 primary and secondary school students in Greater Taipei every day, the Exhibition Section at the time had also organized the \"Events and Creativity\" children's classes and \"Cultural Artifact Seminars\". Dr. Chin also demanded greater novelty and refinement: the \"San-Xi Hall\" was established to merge art with everyday life; the construction of the Garden of Perfected Benevolence, in imitation of Song and Ming gardens, was completed below the western wing of the Main Hall; \"Zhide Garden\" was built by the pathway below the eastern wing; \"Ho Le Yuan\" was constructed on an odd lot of land by the right side of the Main Hall; and landscapes were added to the patio at the Main Hall to create an indoor garden and resting place for visitors.\n\nIn 1987 the \"National Palace Museum Organization Statute\" was promulgated by order of the President, and the Director of the Museum was specially appointed by the Executive Yuan. Another overall inventory of the cultural artifacts took place from July 1978 and was completed in May 1991. In the same year the Executive Yuan appointed a \"Guidance Commissioner\" to replace the original \"Managerial Committee\", and the fourth stage of expansion was completed in 1995 with construction of the Library Building. By this time the Museum boasted a bright and spacious modern library, as well as an exhibition hall of almost 400 pings (Chinese measurement of size in two-dimensions) that enabled active planning of exhibits on loan. On the day that the Library Building was inaugurated, 71 famous landscape paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries from the Musee du Louvre were exhibited, attracting innumerous enthusiastic visitors. The Museum further collaborated with Taiwanese jade collectors to offer the \"Jade Exhibition\" at the end of the same year, also introducing guided tours with Chinese, English and Japanese audios. These were followed by \"Sculpture Exhibition\" (1997), \"Legendary Beauty: Western Paintings and Sculptures\", \"The World of Picasso\" (1998), \"Legend of San-Xing-Dui\" and \"Art and Culture of the Han Dynasty\" (1999). The Museum not only invited loans of artifacts from Taiwanese collectors and from China, exhibitions were also moved into the international arena. At the invitation of the Metropolitan Museum in the U.S., the \"Splendors of Imperial China\" exhibition, comprising of 452 selected pieces from the National Palace Museum's collection, toured four major U.S. cities in March 1996. In October 1998 a selection of 344 pieces were exhibited at the Grand Palais Museum of Paris under the title \"Memories of an Empire: Treasures from the National Palace Museum\". In January 1999 a number of excellent reproductions of National Palace Museum artifacts toured Central America, at the invitation of seven friendly nations of Taiwan in Central America.\n\nEmphasis on Local Culture, Fashion and Innovations\nMr. Tu Cheng-sheng assumed director position of the Museum in May 2000, managing the Museum under visions of emphasizing local culture and enhancing Taiwan awareness. Under his leadership the exhibition \"Ilha Formosa: The Emergence of Taiwan on the World Scene in the 17th Century\" was presented in 1993, and attracted widespread public discussions. As a researcher of historical studies, he asked that the exhibition staff break free from past tradition of exhibiting by material type, but instead present the exhibits chronologically. Using the opportunity of overall re-organization of the Main Hall display route (the fifth expansion project), the relics and artifacts of the Museum were organized to form 8,000 years of historical timeline, leading to the chronologically-linked exhibitions of \"The Neolithic Age: The Beginning of Civilization\", \"Classical Civilization: The Bronze Age\", \"From Classic to Tradition: Qing and Han Dynasties\", \"Transitions and Convergences\", \"Prototypes of Modern Styles\", \"The New Era or Ornamentation\", \"The Contest of Craft: Ming Dynasty's Chia-ching to Chung-chen\", \"Treasures from an Age of Prosperity: The Reigns of Emperors Kangxi, Yongzheng and Qianlong\", and \"Toward Modernity: Late Qing Dynasty\".\n\nDr. Du introduced business management concepts and work systems, issued the \"Regulations on Management and Use of Income and Expenses of the Cultural Relics and Art Development Fund\", and introduced the \"Friends of NPM\" and National Palace Museum Affinity Cards. In line with the Government's policy for a balance of cultural establishments in northern and southern Taiwan, in 2003 the Executive Yuan approved the designation of a 70-acre site at Taipao City, Chiayi County owned by Taiwan Sugar Corporation as the site for construction of the Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum.\n\nIn 2005 Director Dr. Shi Shou-chien took over as the new director, after 4 years as the deputy director assisting Dr. Du in promoting academic researches and holding regular small conferences. Dr. Shi was the founder of the NTU Graduate Institute of Art History, specializing in research of paintings. He personally led the organization of the \"Age of the Great Khan Pluralism in Chinese Art and Culture under the Mongols\" Exhibition, which required collaboration between different sections of the Museum, and hosted an \"Academic Symposium on the Mongols\" in line with the Exhibition. Two years later he also planned the \"Emperor Qianlong's Cultural Enterprise\" Exhibition. The \"Grand View: Painting and Calligraphy and Ju Ware from the Northern Song Dynasty\" and \"Song Dynasty Rare Books\" Exhibitions were held in commemoration of the National Palace Museum's 80th anniversary, as well as an international symposium on \"Founding Paradigms: The Art and Culture of the Northern Song\", which had been a major event for the National Palace Museum and the Chinese art history academia. In light of the fact that all top international museums boasted of a first-class restaurant, Dr. Shi decisively contracted for BOT construction of \"Silks Palace at the National Palace Museum\" on the site of the old employees' canteen. Silks Palace opened for business to the public in June 2008.\n\nIn 2006, with the reorganization of the Executive Yuan, Ms. Lin Mun-lee took office as the new director of the National Palace Museum, and immediately undertook the conceptual reform of \"Old is New at the NPM\". Under this cultural creativity theme, NPM branded products and brand licensing were promoted. The Museum also collaborated with renowned local and international brands, such as Sanrio of Japan, Alessi of Italy, Franz Porcelain and I-Mei Foods of Taiwan in development of new products.\n\nReturning to Professionalism and Creating New Possibilities\nOn May 20, 2008 a change of political parties took place in Taiwan, and Professor Chou Kung-Shin took office as the new director of the National Palace Museum. Director Chou had previously worked at the Museum for 27 years, having been secretaries to former directors Chiang and Chin, and then the head of the Exhibition Department for 16 years. She is an experienced museum expert who founded the Graduate Institute of Museum Studies of Fu Jen Catholic University after leaving the National Palace Museum. Since taking office, she has guided the Museum staff in enhancing the standards of archiving, researching, exhibitions, education, preservation and other fundamental but essential functions of the Museum, as well as re-introducing professional management to the Museum through organizational and staff-restructuring. Her vision is to create \"new vivacity of the collection and new values for the National Palace Museum\".\n\nDuring the past year the Museum has undertaken large-scale solicitation, maintenance and itemizing its collection, promoted international and cross-strait exchanges so to encourage tourism, planned a cultural and creative industrial park, held series of cultural and creative events, nurtured lovers of cultural artifacts from different levels and age groups, improved the exhibition environment and spatial efficiency, as well as actively planning and constructing the Southern Branch. All of these efforts are beginning to show their results. Dr. Chou has also implemented business management, marketing and inter-industry affiliation concepts in integrating resources in and out to make the National Palace Museum an even more pluralistic and lively exhibition environment.\n\nIn December 2008 the Executive Yuan approved \"Cross-Strait Palace Museums\" as one of its major policies. In line with the Government's promotion of normalization of relationships between China and Taiwan, the National Palace Museum has conducted active exchanges with various major museums in China, including the Beijing Palace Museum, Shanghai Museum, Nanjing Museum and Shenyang Museums. A number of understandings about exchanges have been established, and regular collaboration mechanisms are now in place to enable even more in-depth exchanges in the future.\n\nFollowing the trend for cultural creativity leading the knowledge of economy, the National Palace Museum has actively planned the building of the NPM Cultural Creativity Industrial Park, in the hopes of using the cultural wealth and international fame of the Museum to turn the National Palace Museum into a creative focus of local and international cultures Through series of cultural creativity events, design teams with creative potential are invited to participate in offering cultural and creative seminars, so as to enable the public to experience products with modern designs that are inherently refined and incorporate elements of the Museum.\n\nThrough brand licensing, the Museum has also enabled suppliers to create innovative derivative products for globalized marketing, so that the NPM Cultural and Creative Industrial Park will become a center of the global cultural creativity industry. Presently the Museum has already acquired neighboring land from the Health Services Management School of the National Security Bureau, and in line with implementation of the plans for the Park, the first \"Cultural and Creative Development Camp\" was held in 2009. Researches, development and design teams for Museum-derivative product suppliers were selected to plan and offer aesthetics, cultural creativity, National Palace Museum collections, and digital value-adding application events and interactive programs, in the hopes of providing a platform for Museum resources and educational training, as well as introduce systems and quality management for the development of Museum products. It is hoped that these long-term training programs will also enhance the quality and content of Museum-related industries, and establish a model for collaboration and marketing between the National Palace Museum and the cultural and creative industry.\n\nIn terms of educational function of the Museum, different educational activities are designed for different age groups and different visitor type. For example: for the general public, regular guided tours and seminars on Museum artifacts are offered, the Children's Gallery is established, seed teacher programs are held, collaboration between the Museum and schools is established, volunteers are trained; the Saturday Nights at NPM programs are designed to suit young visitors, tours of artifact duplications are arranged for cities, counties and off-island areas farther away; \"Night Feasts at the NPM\" that combine fascinating exhibitions with educational activities are held at San-Xi Hall; and traditional theater under the theme of \"New Melody at the NPM\", combining appreciation of artifacts with performance arts, are held at the Audience Hall. In addition, computerized technology and the U-Museum project have also enabled the National Palace Museum to break free from its physical boundaries, and bring the wondrous collections and educational resources of the Museum into the daily lives of the public.\n\nSince taking office, Dr. Chou has been actively promoting the plans for construction of the Southern Branch. However, the project has met a number of barriers, including inappropriate promotional strategy under the original plans, termination of management consultancy, landscaping consultancy and architectural consultancy contracts, as well as damages suffered due to Typhoon Morakot. The Executive Yuan has put together several meetings to discuss and to solve these problems, finally reaching an agreement on December 17, 2009 that subsequent construction will take place in two stages, with the Construction and Planning Agency of the Ministry of Interior to be responsible for construction of the main buildings and related work under Stage I. \n\nIn 2009 more than 2.5 million visitors had come to the National Palace Museum. In order to provide visitors with more comfortable exhibition and reception areas and a pleasant environment and experience, the Museum is currently planning an organic integration with the neighboring site for the National Palace Museum Cultural Creativity Industry Park and evaluating the feasibility of \"Stage 6 Expansion\". It is hoped that the National Palace Museum will continue to keep up with the times, find new life in old traditions, and create new possibilities through professional expertise.\n",

    "description": "<b>38 Artists, 42 Artworks</b><br/>In 1930, to commemorate Kojima Torajiro, a Western-style painter who died the previous year, Kurashiki entrepreneur, Ohara Magosaburo, founded the Ohara Museum of Art. This private museum, featuring Western art, is the oldest in Japan.\n\nMagosaburo, well-known as a collector of Japanese art, highly respected Torajiro's talent and his humble attitude towords art, and sent Torajiro to Europe three times. Torajiro studied art in Europe and, at the same time, with Magosaburo's superb European artwork, choosing pieces through the sense of beauty that he possessed as a Japanese artist.\n\nTorajiro, who had a spirit typical of Meiji Era, felt there was a struggle between the highlights of Western art and his Japanese aesthetic sense, when he carefully chose artwork. He prudently chose masterpieces by El Greco, Gauguin, Monet, Matisse and other artists and brought them to Kurashiki, which are now the main features of the Ohara Museum of Art. His collection of Chinese and Egyptian art reveals the conflict of beauty between Western and Oriental art that he faced, where he tried to seek the essence of art.\n\nThe Ohara Museum of Art plays an active role in Kurashiki, expanding the collection to include both modern and contemporary art from the West and Japan, as well as pieces by artists who served Mingei Movement (Japanese Folk Art Movement). Now the museum is well known to the world as a private museum with its own character, reflecting Japanese culture.\n\nThe Ohara Museum of Art, in addintion to opening the eyes of children and adults on site, soends time and energy on distance learning programs. As an art museum that will actively live through the 21st century, it also serves for broad activities cultivating the frontier of art. Art Lectures are held every summer, and Gallery Concerts, inviting world-class musecians, are part of its activities.",

This cultural endeavor, Pera Museum, is situated in a historical building structure  which was originally constructed in 1893 by the architect Achille Manoussos in Tepebaşı (İstanbul's most prestigious district in those days) and which was, until rather recently, known as the “Bristol Hotel”, was completely renovated to serve as a museum and cultural center for the project. Transformed into a fully-equipped modern museum, this venerable building is now serving the people of İstanbul once again.\n\nPera Museum encompasses: the Suna and İnan Kıraç Foundation’s three particular collections on the 1st and 2nd museum floors (2nd floor is the Sevgi and Erdoğan Gönül Gallery), for temporary exhibitions (3rd, 4th, 5th floors), auditorium / Pera Education (under ground floor) and located at the ground floor are the Reception, Art Shop and Pera Café. \n\nThe Museum’s first floor displays largely examples from the Foundation's collection of Anatolian Weights and Measures made from many different materials using many different techniques, these objects show the development of the devices used to weigh and measure in Anatolia since the earliest times to twentieth century. In another wing on the same floor is the Foundation's collection of Kütahya Tiles and Ceramics, whose strikingly beautiful pieces seek to shed new light on an area of creativity in Turkish cultural history that is not very well known.\n\nIn addition to its function as a private museum which entails exhibiting the Foundation Collections, Pera Museum as a modern cultural center located in a vibrant part of the city, also aims to provide the people of İstanbul with a broad range of cultural services that include a variety of temporary exhibitions as well as film, educational, conference and lecture programs.\n\n",

    "description": "<b>5 Artists, 61 Artworks</b><br/>The Pergamonmuseum, the youngest of the five buildings of the Museumsinsel, was opened in 1930. The orientation of the neighbouring buildings to the Lustgarten and the Palace was given up in favour of an axis that was to pass by Humboldt University to the street Unter den Linden and on to the Brandenburger Tor. This shift of the axis and the immensity of the structure permanently changed the historic concept of the Museumsinsel.\n\nThis three winged construct drafted by Alfred Messel starting in 1906 was executed after his death by Ludwig Hoffmann under the most difficult of technical as well as political conditions and completed after 20 years of construction. The fourth wing at the Kupfergraben and the portico in the central forum were not realised. Four museums shared the new building, with the Deutsches Museum in the North Wing, the Antikenmuseum (Classical Antiquities) in the central block and the Vorderasiatisches (Ancient Near East) and Islmisches (Islamic Art) museums in the South Wing.\n\nThe war damages of 1945 were remedied between 1948 and 1959, with the Kunstgewerbemuseum (Museum of Applied Arts) and the Ostasiatisches (Far East) Museum taking the place of the Deutsches Museum in the North Wing. During 1980-1982 a new entrance pavilion was constructed to handle the rapidly rising number of visitors. Indeed, due to its unique exhibition programme of ancient monumental architecture, the Pergamonmuseum has become one of the most popular museums in Berlin, attracting approximately one million visitors every year.\n\nThe architect Professor O. M. Ungers from Cologne, who died in 2007, won the competition in 2000 for creation of a closed circuit and for connection to the Archaeological Promenade and the new reception building.\n\nAccording to these plans, a main circuit is to be created with a supplementary fourth wing which unifies the exhibits of monumental architecture of the Cygyptisches Museum (Egyptian and Ancient Near East Museum), the Vorderasiatisches Museum (Museum of the Ancient Near East), the Antikensammlung (Collection of Classical Antiquities and the Museum Islamische Kunst (Museum of Islamic Art) into a single presentation. Moreover, the Pergamonmuseum is integrated into the organism of the entire Museumsinsel, whereby the insular character will be experienced in a new quality.\n\nIn the future, it will be possible at all times - even when the museums are not open - to walk from the Kolonnadenhof of the Alte Nationalgalerie and the Neues Museum through opened passageways to the Ehrenhof (Honours Courtyard) of the Pergamonmuseum and from there directly to the courtyards of the Bode-Museum without having to leave the island, as had always been the case before. Thus the Ehrenhof will develop a new quality as a forum with a distributor function. There will also be a passageway from the new central reception building (James Simon-Galerie) directly to the main circuit in the Pergamonmuseum. The Archeological Promenade will connect the Pergamonmuseum to both its neighbours, the Neues Museum and the Bode-Museum. ",

Founded in 1905 by the Government of the State of S=E3o Paulo, it belongs to the State Secretariat of Culture and is the oldest art museum in the city. It is housed in the old building of the Arts and Crafts School designed at the end of the 19th century by the Ramos de Azevedo architectural firm. At the end of the 1990s the building underwent a substantial refurbishment planned by architect Paulo Mendes da Rocha.  The Pinacoteca=92s original collection was formed by transferring 26 works from what was then the State Museum =96 today the Paulista Museum of the University of São Paulo by important artists who were working in the city at that time, such as Almeida Junior, Pedro Alexandrino, Antonio Parreiras and Oscar Pereira da Silva. The museum spent its first hundred years of activity gathering works of art and has built up a significant collection that today holds about 9,000 works. It has gradually taken on the role of a museum of contemporary art, committed to the works of its time and is an important presence in Brazil=92s artistic landscape. \nThe Pinacoteca holds about 30 exhibitions and receives approximately 500,000 visitors per year. The first floor is given over to temporary exhibitions and the second to the long-term display from the collection. The central area holds the Contemporary Art Octagon Project and on the ground floor are the technical facilities, the auditorium and the cafeteria. Also on the second floor is the Tactile Gallery of Brazilian Sculpture with an exhibition of 12 works that have been specially mounted so that visitors with visual handicaps can appreciate them independently, touching them and obtaining information by means of labels and texts in print and braille, as well as with an audio guide.\n\nOn the ground floor, as well as the technical areas, there is an exhibition on the history of the Pinacoteca based on its Chronology and Victor Brecheret Via crucis, a group of 26 terracotta sculptures. The work developed by the Pinacoteca de São Paulo aims to improve the public=92s experiences in relation to the visual arts by means of studying, preserving and informing the public about its holdings, buildings and history; by consolidating and increasing its collections, and by encouraging artistic production.\n",

    "description": "<b>11 Artists, 22 Artworks</b><br/>Monkeys and lions, an eagle and a peacock, even a “Bolognese lapdog” are assembled here: the hall of Meissen porcelain animals is a special attraction within the Porzellansammlung (Porcelain Collection). The Dresden collection is the most exquisite, and also the largest, specialist ceramics collection in the world, not least on account of the outstanding holdings of early Meissen porcelain as well as oriental porcelain dating from the 17th and early 18th centuries. Augustus the Strong (1670-1733) was passionate about porcelain. It is to his \"maladie de porcelaine\", as he himself called his obsession with the \"white gold\", that Dresden owes its unique collection. The most beautiful items from among the 20,000 objects that have been preserved are now on display in the delightful rooms inside the Zwinger, against the constant Baroque backdrop of the Zwinger courtyard. The spectrum of porcelain wares on show extends from specimens dating from the Ming Dynasty in China and abundant holdings from the reign of Emperor Kangxi (1662–1722) to Japanese Imari and Kakiemon wares from the early 17th and the 18th century. The development of Meissen porcelain from its invention in the year 1708 until the late 18th century is also illustrated by works of supreme craftsmanship. \n\nOver the past few years, the internationally renowned New York architect Peter Marino has drawn up designs for the interior decoration of the two Bogengalerien(Curved Galleries) and the Tiersaal (Animal Hall). In the Langgalerie (Long Gallery), for example, there is an opulent wall arrangement with turquoise porcelain in front of a purple violet wall. This ensemble was planned in a larger form for the Porcelain Palace – the Japanische Palais (Japanese Palace). The Animal Hall features leather wall coverings after the fashion of the early 18th century. And in the middle of the hall are two Chinese-style baldachins with a five-metre high pavilion in Chinese design topped by a pagoda roof and featuring porcelain bells. On gilt wall consoles there are porcelain birds designed by the Meissen modeller Kaendler – also in the 18th century.\n\nThe Porzellansammlung (Porcelain Collection) is part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) that are among the most prominent museums in the world. The combined holdings of the twelve museums offer the visitor a remarkable thematic diversity. These museums originated from the collections of the Saxon electors and Polish kings. They systematically developed cabinets of curiosities, which were accessible to select circles in their day and still form the core of the wonderful art treasures of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden today. The collections are situated in world famous buildings such as the Residenzschloss (Royal Palace), the Zwinger, and the Semperbau (Semper Building), which are among the most important sights in Dresden.",

    "description": "<b>38 Artists, 49 Artworks</b><br/>The ceremony for the laying of the Museum’s foundation stone took place on August 17, 1898 in the presence of Tsar Nicholas II and members of his family. The name of the museum – Alexander III Fine Arts Museum – was officially approved. Building work had commenced a month before that ceremony, which was important as by then the Committee for the Establishment of the Museum already had at its disposal a major part of its collections.\r\nThe Museum was created on the basis of Moscow University’s “Cabinet of Fine Arts and Antiquities” which had been set up as both a public museum and one for educational purposes. In it the main stages in the history of art from ancient times until the post-Renaissance era were represented through casts, models, painted copies and galvanocopies. This museum was the first of its kind in Russia. Work to create it had been initiated (1893) by the highly respected Professor Ivan Tsvetaev (1847-1943), who had a doctorate in Latin literature and art history and was later to be the Museum’s first director (1911-1913).\r\nAt the end of 1896 a competition to design the building for the Museum was announced and 19 architects from various cities in Russia took part. From among the entrants the University Board selected Moscow architect, Roman Klein (1858-1924), to build the Museum. It was constructed in keeping with the latest building techniques and principles of museum practice. The design was based on the model of a Classical temple on a high podium with an Ionic colonnade along its facade. The interior decoration combined elements drawn from the various historical periods represented by the exhibits. Engineers I.I.Rerberg and V.G.Shukhov were involved in the construction work.",

    "description": "<b>1 Artists, 5 Artworks</b><br/>The Rock Art Research Institute \nat the University of the Witwatersrand\n\nThe history of the Rock Art Research Institute (RARI) began in 1978 when David Lewis-Williams secured a small grant to study the rock art Harrismith District. While the Institute remained a small research outfit until 1994, South Africa's post-liberation governments have strongly promoted the study of past cultural achievements, past indigenous beliefs and, in particular, rock art. Rock art now appears at the heart of the national coat-of-arms (RARI advised the President on the choice of image), the insignia used on all public documents, buildings and even on the national currency. Rock art and pre-colonial heritage is also now taking on the natural and pivotal position in South African schools' historical education that it was denied under Nationalist Party rule. \n\nThis transformation in the societal acknowledgement and celebration of rock art and indigenous heritage is having a profound impact on all aspects of RARI research and public outreach. In recent years RARI has initiated a range of important international student and staff exchanges as well as a series of international research collaborations. RARI has recently run projects in Swaziland, Lesotho, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya. RARI’s international collaborations include staff and student exchanges with USA, Mexico, UK, China, Norway, Sweden, Germany and France. At home, RARI has constructed an African-wide rock art digital archive (www.sarada.co.za) and built the South African Museum of Rock Art (www.origins.org.za).\n\nRARI is now the world leader both in rock art research and in rock art training. During the past decade RARI staff have published more than 100 scholarly articles and 15 popular books. RARI now produces more rock art graduates that any other institution in the world. With its new rock art museum in the Origins Centre, RARI also seeks to become a world leader in rock art presentation and rock art tourism. RARI is thus initiating a range of pre-tertiary training programmes in rock art guiding and rock art site management so as to use its strengths to drive rural job creation. The advantage of rock art tourism is that it takes visitors away from the overcrowded 'honey pot' tourist destinations and takes them into rural areas where jobs and income generation are most desperately needed. Rock art tourism/management is therefore a newly combined focus of RARI research and public outreach. RARI is also a flagship Research Institute in terms of transformation. More than 60% of its staff members are from historically disadvantaged groups. RARI is a centre both of research excellence and transformation.\n",

    "description": "<b>17 Artists, 25 Artworks</b><br/>The Royal Armoury is a museum located in the basement of the Royal Palace's southern wing in Stockholm. Together with the Hallwyl Museum and Skokloster Castle the museum constitutes a national authority, headed by a Director General, and accountable to the Ministry of Culture. The three museums base their work on a national cultural policy resolution enacted by Swedish Parliament. The main purpose of the museum is the portrayal of Sweden's royal history from Gustav Vasa up until present day. For almost five hundred years, items once in the possession of Swedish monarchs and their families have been kept here. From generation to generation, they have built up an ever-expanding collection of memories from the country=92s different dynasties, evoking well-known events in Swedish history. Most of the artefacts in the Royal Armoury's rich and varied collection reflect official occasions such as state ceremonies, weddings, coronations and funerals, with magnificent ceremonial costumes, carriages, saddles, armour and weapons. Seen from an international perspective, the Royal Armoury is unique, with regards not only to the age and high quality of its clothing and weaponry collections, but also to its centuries-old tradition of displaying an assortment of royal mementoes of more emotive nature. The Royal Armoury served first as instrument in the royal quest for legitimacy. Through time it became the memento collection of the Swedish nation and today we have a modern cultural-historical museum interacting with its surroundings on a widespread basis.\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe Royal Armoury's oldest artefacts are the sets of royal state and ceremonial weapons that were stored in the old Three Crowns Palace during the 16th century. It was in this royal armoury that Gustavus Adolphus in the 1620's wanted his blood-spattered clothes to be saved as a perpetual memoria. This became the Royal Armoury's hallmark: blood-stained costumes preserved to bear witness to royal valor. In the 1850s the ceremonial costumes of Sweden's royals were taken from the Royal Wardrobe and incorporated into the Royal Armoury. Other valuable ceremonial props for parades, such as saddles, has been on view in the Royal Armoury since the 17th century, whilst it was not until the end of the 19th century that the royal carriages were moved from the royal stables. Artefacts with some association to the royals at war, or with political or ceremonial affiliations, have principally come to the museum directly from the royal family. Since the middle of the 19th century however the museum has also received items such as royal costumes donated by or acquired from the general public. These reflect different types of relationships between the royals and the Swedish people.\n",

Comprising almost all aspects of the fine and decorative arts and running to more than a million objects, it is held in trust by The Queen as Sovereign for her successors and the nation.\n \nThe Royal Collection is a unique and valuable record of the personal tastes of kings and queens over hundreds of years. Following the execution of Charles I in 1649, the greater part of the King's magnificent possessions was sold by order of Oliver Cromwell, and the Royal Collection has largely been formed since the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. The most important additions to the Royal Collection were made by Frederick, Prince of Wales, George III, George IV, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and Queen Mary, consort of King George V.\n \nThe Royal Collection includes the majority of the contents of some 13 royal residences and former residences across the UK, most of which are regularly open to the public. These include Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, Hampton Court, the Tower of London, Kensington Palace, Osborne House and the Royal Pavilion, Brighton. Here, works of art can often be seen in the historic settings for which they were originally commissioned or acquired.\n \nOver 3,000 objects from the Royal Collection are on long-term loan to museums and galleries around the UK and abroad, including The British Museum, The National Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Museum of London, the National Museum of Wales and the National Gallery of Scotland. Many more are lent to temporary exhibitions around the world.\n \nAt The Queen's Galleries in London and Edinburgh, and in the Drawings Gallery, Windsor Castle, aspects of the Collection are shown in a programme of special exhibitions.

    "description": "<b>22 Artists, 36 Artworks</b><br/>The eyes of the visitors focus on the sumptuous armour for horse and rider that was made between 1563 and 1564 by the Antwerp goldsmith Eliseus Libaerts. Many remember it as the “golden suit of armour” or as the “Hercules armour”. This suit of armour, which is without a doubt an artistic magnum opus, is centrally located at the end of the armoury’s impressive columned hall in the Semperbau (Semper building) at the Zwinger Palace.\n\nMoving on to the in the year 2010 opened Türckische Cammer (Turkish Chamber)in the Residenzschloss (Royal Palace) the visitor will be overwhelmed by the eight life-sized, hand-carved wooden horses, one of the definite highlights of the permanent exhibition. Weighing 150 kg, each of these magnificently decorated Arabian horses is unique. Right at the beginning of the tour through the exhibition the visitor is greeted by a large display case showing five of these magnificently decorated horses. As varied as the two exhibitions of this important museum are, they both have one thing in common: the fact that the visitor is overwhelmed by the large number of magnificent weapons and hardly knows where to look first.\nOriginating from weapons owned by Saxon Dukes and Electors, the Dresden Rüstcammer (Armoury) has one of the most valuable collections of weapons and armoury in the world. It unites the masterpieces of armourers, artists and artisans from all corners of Europe and the Orient and includes around 10,000 ceremonial weapons – armour, helmets, shields, swords, rapiers and daggers, sabres and maces, pistols and rifles. The exhibition also includes riding equipment, ceremonial clothes and works of art works as well as portraits which are largely from the 16th to 18th century and come from the collection of the Wettin Elector. The Turkish fashion that was popular at the Electoral Saxon court is reflected by the exquisite collection of oriental and oriental-style weapons, clothes and riding equipment as well as in the magnificent Turkish tents. These resplendent items can be viewed in the Türckische Cammer (Turkish Chmaber) in the Residenzschloss (Royal Palace). In the Semperbau (Semper building) the armoury exhibits its rich collection of portraits of princes and works of art, but above all, the richly decorated weapons. These served not only to protect the Saxon rulers but also had a representative function, were collector’s items and were used at jousting tournaments, court festivities and for hunting. In February 2013 the Rüstkammer (Armoury)will be reopened in the Riesensaal (Giant’s Hall) in the Residenzschloss (Royal Palace).\n\nRüstkammer mit Türckischer Cammer (Armoury with Turkish Chamber) is part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) that are among the most prominent museums in the world. The combined holdings of the twelve museums offer the visitor a remarkable thematic diversity. These museums originated from the collections of the Saxon electors and Polish kings.

These ever-expanding holdings are the basis for original exhibitions featuring key examples of Modernism as well as more recent work that reflects artistic developments occurring regionally, nationally, and around the world. The museum also presents an array of special traveling exhibitions that contribute to SFMOMA's longstanding reputation as a cultural catalyst, a dynamic art center where visitors can learn, reflect, and be inspired.</p>",

    "description": "<b>12 Artists, 12 Artworks</b><br/><p>The Serpentine Gallery is among the top 10 most visited museums and galleries in London. Presenting a broad range of programmes covering international contemporary art, architecture, design, education and public programmes, it is the only publicly funded modern and contemporary art gallery in central London to maintain consistently free admission and to remain open seven days a week. The Gallery is situated in the heart of London's Royal Parks: Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Since 1970, the Serpentine has gained an international reputation for excellence, presenting pioneering exhibitions of 1,500 artists, architects and designers over 41 years, from ground-breaking exhibitions of major artists, such as Louise Bourgeois, Gerhard Richter and Andy Warhol, to career-defining exhibitions by the emerging artists of their time, including Damien Hirst, Cornelia Parker and Mark Wallinger. </p>\n<br/>\n<p>Since 2000 the Serpentine Gallery has commissioned internationally acclaimed architects to build their first structure in the UK. This annual architectural commission is unique worldwide and, following over a decade of ambitious and visionary projects, the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion is now the 4th most visited architecture or design exhibition in the world (<i>The Art Newspaper</i> annual visitor survey, April 2011).</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Architects and designers of the Pavilion have been: Peter Zumthor, 2011;Jean Nouvel, 2010; Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa (SANAA) 2009; Frank Gehry, 2008; Olafur Eliasson and Kjetil Thorsen, 2007; Rem Koolhaas and Cecil Balmond, Arup 2006; Alvaro Siza and Eduardo Souto de Mouro with Cecil Balmond, Arup 2005; Oscar Niemeyer, 2003; Toyo Ito with Arup 2002; Daniel Libeskind with Arup, 2001; Zaha Hadid 2000.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The Serpentine Gallery Pavilion operates as a public space and as a venue for Park Nights and the Marathon, the Gallery's high-profile programme of public talks and events. Serpentine Gallery Marathons are a unique series of events that brings together the fields of art, culture, science and technology each year in an ambitious two-day, live programme of continuous presentations from over 50 international participants. Focusing on one topic annually, previous Marathons have included Garden Marathon, 2011; Map Marathon, 2010 (at the Royal Geographical Society); Poetry Marathon 2009; Manifesto Marathon, 2008; Experiment Marathon, 2007 and the Interview Marathon, 2006.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The Serpentine pioneers international collaborations between the Gallery, local communities and worldwide partners, including two exhibitions organised with Oslo=92s Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art. <i>China Power Station</i>, at Battersea Power Station in London, presented the work of this new generation of Chinese artists and gave the public access to the Power Station for the first time. Indian Highway is currently touring across Norway, Denmark, France, Italy, Russia, Hong Kong, Brazil and India, after its inaugural showing in the UK.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The Serpentine engages unique, new and diverse audiences through its renowned education and public programmes. With late AC night summer events, film screenings, performances, free Saturday talks, artist-led workshops, community and schools outreach, conferences and symposia and downloadable artists walks, it provides children, young people and adults of all ages with unparalleled opportunities to discover, explore and engage with art, design and architecture.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Innovative partnerships with public funders and private philanthropy has been the Serpentine Gallery's hallmark for over 20 years. Receiving just 18% of its annual income from Arts Council England in 2010/11, the Gallery raises the balance from a wide range of corporate supporters, private donors and earned income.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The Gallery regularly brings unique temporary installations to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, including the first contemporary art exhibition in Kensington Gardens for over 25 years: <i>Anish Kapoor: Turning the World Upside Down</i>, an exhibition organised by The Royal Parks and the Serpentine Gallery in 2010/11. Additionally, within the grounds of the Gallery is an important, permanent work by artist and poet Ian Hamilton Finlay, dedicated to the Serpentine's former Patron, Diana, Princess of Wales. The work comprises eight benches, a tree plaque and a carved stone circle at the Gallery's entrance.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Building on its long-standing and wide-ranging success, the Serpentine Gallery will open its new space, the Serpentine Sackler Gallery, in 2012. This innovative arts venue for the 21st century will be housed in the Grade II-listed building formerly known as The Magazine, situated in Kensington Gardens. Designed by Zaha Hadid, the new gallery will offer exhibition and social space and will present the best in emerging international talent across all art forms, including art, architecture, dance, design, fashion, film, literature, music, performance, science and technology. Public engagement and cultural learning will be at the heart of these programmes, which will include an annual large-scale light installation inside the building and an outdoor playscape for children and adults of all ages. Like the Serpentine Gallery, it will be free of charge and accessible to all.</p>\n",

    "description": "<b>35 Artists, 45 Artworks</b><br/>Skokloster Castle is located at the countryside 60 km northwest of Stockholm, the Swedish capital. Together with the Hallwyl Museum and the Royal Armoury the castle constitutes a national authority, headed by a Director General, and accountable to the Ministry of Culture. The three museums base their work on a national cultural policy resolution enacted by Swedish Parliament. Skokloster Castle is one of the mayor monuments from the period when Sweden was one of the most powerful countries in Europe. It's built in the baroque style between 1654 and 1676. At Skokloster the Field Marshal and Count Carl Gustaf Wrangel (1613-1676) created a stately home of European caliber during the second half of the 17th century. Just like continental princes, he tried to understand the world by collecting the most remarkable things that Man and nature were capable of making. The castle has remained amazingly untouched for more than 300 years, giving this building a unique authenticity. Wrangel and the following owners collected fine arts like armory, books, silver, glass, textiles and furniture. The collection consists of about 50 000 items in the 77 rooms in the Castle. Skokloster is considered one of the great castles of Baroque Europe.\n\nBACKGROUND\nSince the owner died in 1676, the castle was never really completed. This is a fact that you can see by your self just visit the banqueting hall which remains in the exact same conditions, tools included, as the builders left it the same day as Wrangel died. Carl Gustaf Wrangel had no son who survived him. Instead Skokloster passed to his daughter, Margareta Juliana. \nShe married Nils Brahe, a member of Sweden's most exalted countly family. She made Skokloster Castle to an entailed estate in 1701.  From that time nothing was allowed to be taken from the Castle. Everything is left intact since late 1700th century. We have to thank her and this form of ownership for our counting possession of its original furnishings and of the objects added through the centuries by inheritance, purchase and donations. The Castle was never a permanent home before 1947 when the von Essen family moved in. They were the last private owners. Since 1967 Skokloster is stately owned. Skokloster Castle has been a national museum of cultural history since 1967. Professor Ove Hidemark's groundbreaking restoration has set the tone of present-day heritage conservation respect for old building techniques and preservation of the atmospheric patina of age.",

    "description": "<b>17 Artists, 25 Artworks</b><br/>In the newly designed Albertinum the exhibitions of the Skulpturensammlung (Sculpture Collection) and the Galerie Neue Meister (New Masters Gallery) will make it possible to encounter modern art on a larger scale than has ever previously been possible in Dresden. The innovative museum concept marks a new beginning in the presentation of art in Dresden and displays the art of the modern period from the beginning of the 19th century up to the present day. For the Skulpturensammlung (Sculpture Collection) the modern era begins with works by the French sculptor Auguste Rodin. He heralded the age of modern statuary art and sculpture and is regarded as the forerunner of numerous styles which developed in the 20th century. The works of the classical modern period and of post-1945 sculpture on show in the exhibition extend Rodin’s principle – that of the subjectivity of art – to the contemporary era.\nThe Klingersaal (Klinger Hall)– designed by the Skulpturensammlung (Sculpture Collection) and the Galerie Neue Meister (New Masters Gallery) as a space in which the spirit of an epoch can be sensed through its art – is devoted to the art of the late 19th century, the ‘Fin de Siècle’, illustrated through works by Arnold Böcklin and Max Klinger down to Franz von Stuck and Sascha Schneider. The Mosaiksaal (Mosaic Hall) dedicated to the theme of morality, exemplified by sculptures from the Classicist period with particular emphasis on Ernst Rietschel.\n\nThe Skulpturensammlung (Sculpture Collection) holds works dating from more than five millennia – from the cultures of classical antiquity via all the various periods of European statuary art from the early Middle Ages down to the present day. In a few years’ time the core holdings of the collection – the Antiquities Collection which includes sculptures such as the “Dresden Boy”, as well as vases, bronzes and terracottas – will be presented in a new exhibition in the Osthalle (eastern wing) of the Semperbau (Semper Building), which was originally designed by Gottfried Semper to house the classical sculptures. Until then, visitors can get a foretaste of the future exhibition in the experimental display storeroom in the Albertinum, where a selection of the sculptures will be on view.\n\nThe Skulpturensammlung (Sculpture Collection) is part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) that are among the most prominent museums in the world. The combined holdings of the twelve museums offer the visitor a remarkable thematic diversity. These museums originated from the collections of the Saxon electors and Polish kings. They systematically developed cabinets of curiosities, which were accessible to select circles in their day and still form the core of the wonderful art treasures of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden today. The collections are situated in world famous buildings such as the Residenzschloss (Royal Palace), the Zwinger, and the Semperbau (Semper Building), which are among the most important sights in Dresden.",

    "description": "<b>9 Artists, 20 Artworks</b><br/>Colorful clothing, weapons, jewelry, and other accessories tell many tales of long-forgotten migrations and contacts with different cultures, or of the close relationships involving religious belief, symbolism, and the practicalities of life. Three museums comprise the Staatliche Ethnographische Sammlungen Sachsen (Saxonian State Collections of Ethnography): the Museum für Völkerkunde Dresden (Ethnographical Museum Dresden); the GRASSI Museum für Völkerkunde zu Leipzig (GRASSI Ethnographical Museum of Leipzig), which was created by the citizens of Leipzig; and the Völkerkundemuseum Herrnhut (Ethnographical Museum Herrnhut).\n\nThe Museum für Völkerkunde Dresden (Ethnographical Museum Dresden)has its roots in the distant past. When August I, Elector of Saxony, founded the Kunstkammer in 1560, he laid the foundations for today’s museum. The items collected by him and his successors reflect their desire for ostentatious courtly display and their fascination with exotic and curious objects. From the 18th century onwards collecting was carried out in a systematic way according to scientific criteria. The year 1875 is regarded as the year of the museum's foundation. It holds an important collection of non-European works of art which is of international importance. Since 1977 changing exhibitions of objects from among its holdings have been held in the Japanische Palais (Japanese Palace).\n\nA tour through the rooms of the GRASSI Museum für Völkerkunde zu Leipzig (GRASSI Ethnographical Museum of Leipzig) is like a journey around the world. The art and everyday life of distant cultures enable visitors to get away from their own day-to-day concerns. In its newly designed rooms in the GRASSI museum at Johannisplatz (John's square), the museum shows items held in the Saxon ethnographical collections originating from nearly every culture in the world.\nSince the 19th century works of art and other articles of daily life have been assembled and these are now among the most significant items for preserving the heritage of many cultures. Exotic, precious and sometimes unique exhibits demonstrate the art and ways of life of a world that has moved closer together but which is still largely unfamiliar. The exhibition tour on the first floor provides exciting insights into the reality of life in Indonesia, India, Tibet and Mongolia, China, Japan, Europe and the Orient. The second tour takes visitors through Africa, America, then on to Australia and Oceania, thus completing the journey around the world. The museum’s famous collections of exceptional objects relating to Siberian shamanism, oriental jewellery and the works of art of Tibetan Buddhism, as well as about the Indian Andaman and Nicobar Islands transport the visitor to distant and fabled worlds.\n\nThe Völkerkundemuseum in Herrnhut (Ethnographical Museum Herrnhut), which was founded in 1878 preserves unique items that testify to the cultural heritage of Alaska and Africa, Asia and America. From 1732 onwards, members of the Moravian Church (Brüder-Unität) which was founded in Herrnhut, travelled to many different peoples in order to preach them the gospel. Numerous missionaries studied the languages and cultures of the various peoples and brought their fascinating objects back to Germany. These ethnographical collections and the many written observations recorded by the missionaries made an important contribution to the establishment of ethnography as a science. Other disciplines such as linguistics, geography, botany and zoology are also indebted to the missionaries for some of their basic literature.\n\nThe Staatliche Ethnographische Sammlungen Sachsen (Saxonian State Collections of Ethnography)\nare part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections) that are among the most prominent museums in the world. The combined holdings of the twelve museums offer the visitor a remarkable thematic diversity, and are situated in Dresden, Leipzig and Herrnhut.",

As the names suggest, these collections have their roots in the art collections of Danish monarchs; they are believed to date back to King Christian II and the mid-16th century.\n\nThe Collection of Sculpture and Painting comprises approximately 10,500 paintings and sculptures, while the Collection of Graphic Art houses more than 245,000 works of art on paper. In addition to this, approximately 2,500 plaster casts are housed at the Royal Cast Collection.\n\nNew works are added to the collections every year. Generous donations and acquisitions have shaped the profile of the collections in recent years, but the starting point remains the collections built by Danish monarchs. ",

We find beauty in paintings and sculpture, but we find it also in tools and furniture, in garden rocks and plants, in the human face. Art's place in everyday life is especially treasured in Japan. The Suntory Museum of Art wishes to bring the joy of \"Art in Life\" to a wider public, rededicating ourselves to a principle that has guided the Museum since its founding in 1961.\n\n\"Art revisited, beauty revealed\" is the mission of the Suntory Museum of Art. It expresses our desire to link ancient art to modern art, eastern art to western art, across the boundaries of time and place and culture. Our aim in boldly presenting art of different origins is to make new connections and open our minds to new discoveries. By challenging conventional attitudes to the classification of art we hope to reveal its beauty afresh.",

    "description": "<b>3 Artists, 5 Artworks</b><br/>The Cloisters museum and gardens, which opened to the public in 1938, is the branch of The Metropolitan Museum of Art devoted to the art and architecture of medieval Europe. Located in Fort Tryon Park in northern Manhattan, The Cloisters was assembled from architectural elements that date from the twelfth through the fifteenth century.\n\nLocated in a spectacular four-acre setting overlooking the Hudson River, the building incorporates elements from five medieval cloisters—Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa, Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert, Bonnefont-en-Comminges, Trie-en-Bigorre, and Froville—and from other monastic sites located in southern France. Three of the cloisters reconstructed at the branch museum feature gardens planted according to horticultural information found in medieval treatises and poetry, garden documents and herbals, and medieval works of art such as tapestries, stained-glass windows, and column capitals. Approximately three thousand works of art from medieval Europe, dating from the ninth to the sixteenth century and including exquisite illuminated manuscripts, stained glass, metalwork, enamels, ivories, and tapestries, are exhibited in this unique context. The modern museum building is not a copy of any specific medieval structure but an ensemble of spaces, rooms, and gardens that suggest a variety of artistic aspects of medieval Europe.\n\nFor more about The Cloisters museum and gardens visit: http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/history-of-the-museum/the-cloisters-museum-and-gardens\n",

    "description": "<b>96 Artists, 139 Artworks</b><br/>For more than 200 years, the White House has been more than just the home of the Presidents and their families. Throughout the world, it is recognized as the symbol of the President, of the President's administration, and of the United States. The White House is the only private residence of a head of state that is open to the public, free of charge.\n\nOur first president, George Washington, selected the site for the White House in 1791. The cornerstone was laid in 1792 and a competition design submitted by Irish-born architect James Hoban was chosen. After eight years of construction, President John Adams and his wife, Abigail, moved into the unfinished house in 1800. During the War of 1812, the British set fire to the President’s House in 1814. James Hoban was appointed to rebuild the house, and President James Monroe moved into the building in 1817. During Monroe’s administration, the South Portico was constructed in 1824, and Andrew Jackson oversaw the addition of the North Portico in 1829. During the late 19th century, various proposals were made to significantly expand the President’s House or to build an entirely new house for the president, but these plans were never realized.\n \nIn 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt began a major renovation of the White House, including the relocation of the president’s offices from the Second Floor of the Residence to the newly constructed temporary Executive Office Building (now known as the West Wing). The Roosevelt renovation was planned and carried out by the famous New York architectural firm McKim, Mead and White. Roosevelt’s successor, President William Howard Taft, had the Oval Office constructed within an enlarged office wing.\n \nLess than fifty years after the Roosevelt renovation, the White House was showing signs of serious structural weakness. President Harry S. Truman began a renovation of the building in which everything but the outer walls were dismantled. The reconstruction was overseen by architect Lorenzo Winslow, and the Truman family moved back into the White House in 1952.\n \nEvery president since John Adams has occupied the White House, and the history of this building extends far beyond the construction of its walls. From the Ground Floor Corridor rooms, transformed from their early use as service areas, to the State Floor rooms, where countless leaders and dignitaries have been entertained, the White House is both the home of the President of the United States his family and a museum of American history. The White House is a place where history continues to unfold.\n",

    "description": "<b>39 Artists, 55 Artworks</b><br/>The Palace in Wilanów belongs to those few places of interest in Warsaw, which remained in its intact form from the period of the Second World War. Situated slightly off the main track, Wilanów remained almost intact and today you can admire this wonderful baroque royal residence.The history of the Palace began on April 23, 1677, when a village became the property of King John Sobieski III.\n\nAt the beginning, the residence built there was small. Augustyn Locci, the king's court architect, received the task of creating only a ground floor residence of a layout typical for the buildings of the republic of Poland. However, military successes and an increase of the importance of royalty in the coming years had a huge influence on expanding the initial project. Huge construction works were conducted in the years 1677-1696. After completion, the building comprised of elements of a nobility house, an Italian garden villa and a French palace in the style of Louis XIV. After the death of the King, the Palace became the property of his sons, and in 1720, a run down property was purchased by one of the wealthiest women in Poland of those days Elizabeth Sieniawska. In 1730, the Palace, for three years, was owned by king August II the Strong, who made considerable changes in the residence, particularly as far as the internal decor is concerned.\n\nIn the middle of 18th century, the Wilanów property was inherited by the daughter of Czartoryski, wife of a field marshal, Izabela Lubomirska, during whose reign, Wilanów started shining with its previous glory. Sixty nine years later, the Duchess gave Wilanów to her daughter and her husband, Stanislaw Kostka Potocki. Thanks to his efforts, one of the first museums in Poland was opened in the Wilanów Palace, in 1805. ",
